##### [Information Content of Higher-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01696) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01696.pdf)

- The shapes of galaxy N-point correlation functions can be used as standard rulers to constrain the distance-redshift relationship and thence the expansion rate of the Universe.
- The cosmological density fields traced by late-time galaxy formation are initially nearly Gaussian, and hence all the cosmological information can be extracted from their 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or its Fourier-space analog the power spectrum.
- Subsequent nonlinear evolution under gravity, as well as halo and then galaxy formation, generate higher-order correlation functions.
- Since the mapping of the initial to the final density field is, on large scales, invertible, it is often claimed that the information content of the initial field's power spectrum is equal to that of all the higher-order functions of the final, nonlinear field.
- This claim implies that reconstruction of the initial density field from the nonlinear field renders analysis of higher-order correlation functions of the latter superfluous.
- We here show that this claim is false when the N-point functions are used as standard rulers.
- Constraints available from joint analysis of the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 3-Point Correlation Function) can, in some cases, exceed those offered by the initial power spectrum even when the reconstruction is perfect.
- We provide a mathematical justification for this claim and also demonstrate it using a large suite of N-body simulations.
- In particular, we show that for the z = 0 real-space matter field in the limit of vanishing shot noise, taking modes up to k_max = 0.2 h/Mpc, using the bispectrum alone offers a factor of two reduction in the variance on the cosmic distance scale relative to that available from the power spectrum.

##### [The Cosmological Trajectories Method: Modelling cosmic structure formation in the non-linear regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01698) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01698.pdf)

- We introduce a novel approach, the Cosmological Trajectories Method (CTM), to model nonlinear structure formation in the Universe by expanding gravitationally-induced particle trajectories around the Zel'dovich approximation.
- A new Beyond Zel'dovich approximation is presented, which expands the CTM to leading second-order in the gravitational interaction and allows for post-Born gravitational scattering.
- In the Beyond Zel'dovich approximation we derive the exact expression for the matter clustering power spectrum.
- This is calculated to leading order and is available in the CTM MODULE.
- We compare the Beyond Zel'dovich approximation power spectrum and correlation function to other methods including 1-loop Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) and Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (CLPT).
- We find that the Beyond Zel'dovich approximation power spectrum performs well, matching simulations to within $\pm{10}\%$, on mildly non-linear scales, and at redshifts above $z=1$ it outperforms the Zel'dovich approximation.
- We also find that the Beyond Zel'dovich approximation models the BAO peak in the correlation function at $z=0$ more accurately, to within $\pm{5}\%$ of simulations, than the Zel'dovich approximation, SPT 1-loop and CLPT.

##### [Living with Neighbors. III. The Origin of the Spin$-$Orbit Alignment of Galaxy Pairs: A Neighbor versus the Large-scale Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01701) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01701.pdf)

- Recent observations revealed a coherence between the spin vector of a galaxy and the orbital motion of its neighbors.
- We refer to the phenomenon as "the spin$-$orbit alignment (SOA)" and explore its physical origin via the IllustrisTNG simulation.
- This is the first study to utilize a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to investigate the SOA of galaxy pairs.
- In particular, we identify paired galaxies at $z = 0$ having the nearest neighbor with mass ratios from 1/10 to 10 and calculate the spin$-$orbit angle for each pair.
- Our results are as follows.
- (a) There exists a clear preference for prograde orientations (i.e., SOA) for galaxy pairs, qualitatively consistent with observations.
- (b) The SOA is significant for both baryonic and dark matter spins, being the strongest for gas and the weakest for dark matter.
- (c) The SOA is stronger for less massive targets and for targets having closer neighbors.
- (d) The SOA strengthens for galaxies in low-density regions, and the signal is dominated by central$-$satellite pairs in low-mass halos.
- (e) There is an explicit dependence of the SOA on the duration of interaction with its current neighbor.
- Taken together, we propose that the SOA witnessed at $z = 0$ has been developed mainly by interactions with a neighbor for an extended period of time, rather than tidal torque from the ambient large-scale structure.

##### [Early Science from POSSUM: Shocks, turbulence, and a massive new reservoir of ionised gas in the Fornax cluster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01702) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01702.pdf)

- We present the first Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid study of an individual low-mass cluster -- the Fornax cluster -- which is presently undergoing a series of mergers.
- Exploiting commissioning data for the POlarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) covering a $\sim34$ square degree sky area using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), we achieve an RM grid density of $\sim25$ RMs per square degree from a 280 MHz band centred at 887 MHz, which is similar to expectations for forthcoming GHz-frequency all-sky surveys.
- We thereby probe the extended magnetoionic structure of the cluster in unprecedented detail.
- We find that the scatter in the Faraday RM of confirmed background sources is increased by $16.8\pm2.4$ rad m$^{-2}$ within 1 degree (360 kpc) projected distance to the cluster centre, which is 2--4 times more extended than the presently-detectable X-ray-emitting intracluster medium (ICM).
- The Faraday-active plasma is more massive than the X-ray-emitting ICM, with an average density that broadly matches expectations for the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium.
- The morphology of the Faraday depth enhancement exhibits the classic morphology of an astrophysical bow shock on the southwest side of the main Fornax cluster, and an extended, swept-back wake on the northeastern side.
- Our favoured explanation is an ongoing merger between the main cluster and a sub-cluster to the southwest.
- The shock's Mach angle and stand-off distance lead to a self-consistent transonic merger speed with Mach 1.06.
- The region hosting the Faraday depth enhancement shows a decrement in both total and polarised intensity.
- We fail to identify a satisfactory explanation for this; further observations are warranted.
- Generally, our study illustrates the scientific returns that can be expected from all-sky grids of discrete sources generated by forthcoming all-sky radio surveys.

##### [Substructure at High Speed I: Inferring the Escape Velocity in the Presence of Kinematic Substructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01704) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01704.pdf)

- The local escape velocity provides valuable inputs to the mass profile of the Galaxy, and requires understanding the tail of the stellar speed distribution.
- Following Leonard $\&$ Tremaine (1990), various works have since modeled the tail of the stellar speed distribution as $\propto (v_{\rm{esc}} -v)^k$, where $v_{\rm{esc}}$ is the escape velocity, and $k$ is the slope of the distribution.
- In such studies, however, these two parameters were found to be largely degenerate and often a narrow prior is imposed on $k$ in order to constrain $v_{\rm{esc}}$.
- Furthermore, the validity of the power law form is likely to break down in the presence of multiple kinematic substructures.
- In this paper, we introduce a strategy that for the first time takes into account the presence of kinematic substructure.
- We model the tail of the velocity distribution as a sum of multiple power laws without imposing strong priors.
- Using mock data, we show the robustness of this method in the presence of kinematic structure that is similar to the recently-discovered Gaia Sausage.
- In a companion paper, we present the new measurement of the escape velocity and subsequently the mass of the Milky Way using Gaia DR2 data.

##### [APOGEE discovery of a chemically atypical star disrupted from NGC 6723 and captured by the Milky Way bulge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01706) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01706.pdf)

- The central (`bulge') region of the Milky Way is teeming with a significant fraction of mildly metal-deficient stars with atmospheres that are strongly enriched in cyanogen ($^{12}$C$^{14}$N).
- Some of these objects, which are also known as nitrogen-enhanced stars, are hypothesised to be relics of the ancient assembly history of the Milky Way.
- Although the chemical similarity of nitrogen-enhanced stars to the unique chemical patterns observed in globular clusters has been observed, a direct connection between field stars and globular clusters has not yet been proven.
- In this work, we report on high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6723, and the serendipitous discovery of a star, 2M18594405$-$3651518, located outside the cluster (near the tidal radius) but moving on a similar orbit, providing the first clear piece of evidence of a star that was very likely once a cluster member and has recently been ejected.
- Its nitrogen abundance ratio ([N/Fe]$\gtrsim + 0.94$) is well above the typical Galactic field-star levels, and it exhibits noticeable enrichment in the heavy $s$-process elements (Ce, Nd, and Yb), along with moderate carbon enrichment; all characteristics are known examples in globular clusters.
- This result suggests that some of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the bulge likely originated from the tidal disruption of globular clusters.

##### [Monte Carlo simulations of multiple populations in globular clusters: constraints on the cooling flow vs. accretion scenario using million bodies simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01707) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01707.pdf)

- I simulate the evolution of a stellar system hosting two stellar populations whose initial set up is defined according to the two main scenarios proposed for the origin of multiple populations in Galactic globular clusters: (i) formation of a second generation from a cooling flow of pristine+polluted gas and (ii) accretion of polluted gas onto the proto-stellar disks of a fraction of low-mass stars.
- For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulations containing from $10^{5}$ up to $3\cdot 10^{6}$ particles have been run including the effect of stellar evolution, binary interactions, external tidal field and a detailed modelling of the proto-stellar disk structure.
- The early accretion of gas onto proto-stellar disks is unable to produce discrete populations and to alter the chemical composition of a significant ($>10\%$) fraction of stars unless a disk lifetime larger ($t_{disk}\sim20~Myr$) than that predicted by models is assumed.
- Moreover, in this scenario the mixing timescale of the two populations is too short to reproduce the observed segregation of the chemically enriched population.
- On the other hand, simulations run within the cooling flow scenario can evolve after a Hubble time into stellar systems with a first-to-second population mass ratio similar to that observed in globular clusters, provided that an initial filling-factor $r_{h}/r_{J}>0.15$ is adopted.
- However, in the weak tidal field regime a radial segregation of the second population stronger than what observed in Milky Way globular clusters at large Galactocentric distances is predicted.
- This discrepancy disappears in simulations following eccentric orbits in a realistic axisymmetric potential.

##### [Gravitational wave cosmology with extreme mass-ratio inspirals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01708) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01708.pdf)

- The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will open the mHz frequency window of the gravitational wave (GW) landscape.
- Among all the new GW sources expected to emit in this frequency band, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) constitute a unique laboratory for astrophysics and fundamental physics.
- Here we show that EMRIs can also be used to extract relevant cosmological information, complementary to both electromagnetic (EM) and other GW observations.
- By using the loudest EMRIs (SNR$>$100) detected by LISA as dark standard sirens, statistically matching their sky localisation region with mock galaxy catalogs, we find that constraints on $H_0$ can reach $\sim$1.1% ($\sim$3.6%) accuracy, at the 90% credible level, in our best (worst) case scenario.
- By considering a dynamical dark energy (DE) cosmological model, with $\Lambda$CDM parameters fixed by other observations, we further show that in our best (worst) case scenario $\sim$5.9% ($\sim$12.3%) relative uncertainties at the 90% credible level can be obtained on $w_0$, the DE equation of state parameter.
- Besides being relevant in their own right, EMRI measurements will be affected by different systematics compared to both EM and ground-based GW observations.
- Cross validation with complementary cosmological measurements will therefore be of paramount importance, especially if convincing evidence of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM emerges from future observations.

##### [The Galactic Faraday rotation sky 2020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01709) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01709.pdf)

- This work gives an update to existing reconstructions of the Galactic Faraday rotation sky by processing almost all Faraday rotation data sets available at the end of the year 2020.
- Observations of extra-Galactic sources in recent years have, among other regions, further illuminated the previously under-constrained southern celestial sky, as well as parts of the inner disc of the Milky Way.
- This has culminated in an all-sky data set of 55,190 data points, which is a significant expansion on the 41,330 used in previous works, hence making an updated separation of the Galactic component a promising venture.
- The increased source density allows us to present our results in a resolution of about $1.3\cdot 10^{-2} \mathrm{deg}^2$ ($46.8 \mathrm{arcmin}^2$), which is a twofold increase compared to previous works.
- As for previous Faraday rotation sky reconstructions, this work is based on information field theory, a Bayesian inference scheme for field-like quantities which handles noisy and incomplete data.
- In contrast to previous reconstructions, we find a significantly thinner and pronounced Galactic disc with small-scale structures exceeding values of several thousand $\mathrm{rad} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$.
- The improvements can mainly be attributed to the new catalog of Faraday data, but are also supported by advances in correlation structure modeling within numerical information field theory.
- We furthermore give a detailed discussion on statistical properties of the Faraday rotation sky and investigate correlations to other data sets.

##### [Probing the Halo Gas Distribution in the Inner Galaxy with Fermi Bubble Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01710) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01710.pdf)

- The hot halo gas distribution in the inner Milky Way (MW) contains key fossil records of the past energetic feedback processes in the Galactic center, such as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles.
- Here we adopt a variety of spherical and disk-like MW halo gas models as initial conditions in a series of simulations to investigate the formation of the Fermi bubbles in the jet-shock scenario.
- The simulation results are compared directly with relevant observations of the Fermi bubbles to constrain the halo gas distribution in the inner Galaxy before the Fermi bubble event.
- Our best-fit gas density distribution can be described by a power law in radius $n_{\rm e}(r)=0.01(r/1 \text{~kpc})^{-1.5}$ cm$^{-3}$.
- Our study can not determine if there is an inner density core, which if exists, should be very small with size $r_{c} \lesssim 0.5$ kpc.
- When extrapolating to large radii $r\sim 50-90$ kpc, our derived density distribution lies appreciably below the recently estimated gas densities from ram-pressure stripping calculations, suggesting that the halo gas density profile either flattens out or has one or more discontinuities within $10 \lesssim r \lesssim 50$ kpc.
- Our derived gas density profile may correspond to the hot gas distribution in the inner 10-kpc region of the eROSITA bubbles about $5$ Myr ago.

##### [On the relation between Lya absorbers and local galaxy filaments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01713) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01713.pdf)

- The intergalactic medium (IGM) is believed to contain the majority of baryons in the universe and to trace the same dark matter structure as galaxies, forming filaments and sheets.
- Lya absorbers, which sample the neutral component of the IGM, have been extensively studied at low and high redshift, but the exact relation between Lya absorption, galaxies and the large-scale structure is observationally not well-constrained.
- In this study, we aim at characterising the relation between Lya absorbers and nearby overdense cosmological structures (galaxy filaments) at recession velocities Delta v \leq 6700 km/s by using archival observational data from various instruments.
- We analyse 587 intervening Lya absorbers in the spectra of 302 extragalactic background sources obtained with the COS installed on the HST.
- We combine the absorption-line information with galaxy data of five local galaxy filaments originally mapped by Courtois et al.
- (2013).
- Along the 91 sightlines that pass close to a filament, we identify 215 (227) Lya absorption systems (components).
- Among these, 74 Lya systems are aligned in position and velocity with the galaxy filaments, indicating that these absorbers and the galaxies trace the same large-scale structure.
- The filament-aligned Lya absorbers have a ~90 percent higher rate of incidence (dN/dz=189 for log N HI \geq 13.2) and a mildly shallower slope (-beta = -1.47) of the column density distribution function than the general Lya population at z=0, reflecting the filaments' matter overdensity.
- The strongest Lya absorbers are preferentially found near galaxies or close to the axis of a filament, although there is substantial scatter in this relation.
- Our sample of absorbers clusters more strongly around filament axes than a randomly distributed sample would do (as confirmed by a KS test), but the clustering signal is less pronounced than for the galaxies in the filaments.

##### [Dynamical Evolution of Multiple-Population Globular Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01717) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01717.pdf)

- We have carried out a set of Monte Carlo simulations to study a number of fundamental aspects of the dynamical evolution of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters with different initial masses, fractions of second generation (2G) stars, and structural properties.
- Our simulations explore and elucidate: 1) the role of early and long-term dynamical processes and stellar escape in the evolution of the fraction of 2G stars and the link between the evolution of the fraction of 2G stars and various dynamical parameters; 2) the link between the fraction of 2G stars inside the cluster and in the population of escaping stars during a cluster's dynamical evolution; 3) the dynamics of the spatial mixing of the first-generation (1G) and 2G stars and the details of the structural properties of the two populations as they evolve toward mixing; 4) the implications of the initial differences between the spatial distribution of 1G and 2G stars for the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and the expected radial profile of the 1G and 2G anisotropy for clusters at different stages of their dynamical history; 5) the variation of the degree of energy equipartition of the 1G and the 2G populations as a function of the distance from the cluster's centre and the cluster's evolutionary phase.

##### [Improved Treatment of Host-Galaxy Correlations in Cosmological Analyses With Type Ia Supernovae](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01776) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01776.pdf)

- Improving the use of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) as standard candles requires a better approach to incorporate the relationship between SNIa and the properties of their host galaxies.
- Using a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of $\sim$1600 SNIa, we develop the first empirical model of underlying populations for SNIa light-curve properties that includes their dependence on host-galaxy stellar mass.
- These populations are important inputs to simulations that are used to model selection effects and correct distance biases within the BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) framework.
- Here we improve BBC to also account for SNIa-host correlations, and we validate this technique on simulated data samples.
- We recover the input relationship between SNIa luminosity and host-galaxy stellar mass (the mass step, $\gamma$) to within 0.004 mags, which is a factor of 5 improvement over the previous method that results in a $\gamma$-bias of ${\sim}0.02$.
- We adapt BBC for a novel dust-based model of intrinsic brightness variations, which results in a greatly reduced mass step for data ($\gamma = 0.017 \pm 0.008$), and for simulations ($\gamma =0.006 \pm 0.007$).
- Analysing simulated SNIa, the biases on the dark energy equation-of-state, $w$, vary from $\Delta w = 0.006(5)$ to $0.010(5)$ with our new BBC method; these biases are significantly smaller than the $0.02(5)$ $w$-bias using previous BBC methods that ignore SNIa-host correlations.

##### [Toward a more stringent test of gravity with redshift space power spectrum: simultaneous probe of growth and amplitude of large-scale structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01785) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01785.pdf)

- Redshift-space distortions (RSD) offers an exciting opportunity to test the gravity on cosmological scales.
- In the presence of galaxy bias, however, the RSD measurement at large scales, where the linear theory prediction is safely applied, is known to exhibit a degeneracy between the parameters of structure growth f and fluctuation amplitude sigma8, and one can only constrain the parameters in the form of fsigma8.
- In order to disentangle this degeneracy, in this paper, we go beyond the linear theory, and consider the model of RSD applicable to a weakly nonlinear regime.
- Based on the Fisher matrix analysis, we show explicitly that the degeneracy of the parameter fsigma8 can be broken, and sigma8 is separately estimated in the presence of galaxy bias.
- Performing further the Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we verify that our model correctly reproduces the fiducial values of fsigma8 and sigma8, with the statistical errors consistent with those estimated from the Fisher matrix analysis.
- We show that upcoming galaxy survey of the stage-IV class can unambiguously determine sigma8 at the precision down to 10% at higher redshifts even if we restrict the accessible scales to k<0.16h/Mpc

##### [Orphan galaxies in semi-analytic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01837) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01837.pdf)

- We present an updated model for the evolution of the orbits of "orphan galaxies" to be used in the SAG semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution.
- In cosmological simulations, orphan galaxies are those satellite galaxies for which, due to limited mass resolution, halo finders lose track of their dark matter subhalos and can no longer be distinguished as self-bound overdensities within the larger host system.
- Since the evolution of orphans depends strongly on the orbit they describe within their host halo, a proper treatment of their evolution is crucial in predicting the distribution of subhalos and satellite galaxies.
- The model proposed takes into account the dynamical friction drag, mass loss by tidal stripping and a proximity merger criterion, also it is simple enough to be inexpensive from a computational point of view.
- To calibrate this model, we apply it onto a dark matter only simulation and compare the results with a high resolution simulation, considering the halo mass function and the two-point correlation function as constraints.
- We show that while the halo mass function fails to put tight constraints on the dynamical friction, the addition of clustering information helps to better define the parameters of the model related to the spatial distribution of subhalos.
- Using the model with the best fit parameters allows us to reproduce the halo mass function to a precision better than 5 per cent, and the two point correlation function at a precision better than 10 per cent.

##### [Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder: I. System Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01870) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01870.pdf)

- In this paper we describe the system design and capabilities of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope at the conclusion of its construction project and commencement of science operations.
- ASKAP is one of the first radio telescopes to deploy phased array feed (PAF) technology on a large scale, giving it an instantaneous field of view that covers 31 square degrees at 800 MHz.
- As a two-dimensional array of 36x12m antennas, with baselines ranging from 22m to 6km, ASKAP also has excellent snapshot imaging capability and 10 arcsecond resolution.
- This, combined with 288 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and a unique third axis of rotation on each antenna, gives ASKAP the capability to create high dynamic range images of large sky areas very quickly.
- It is an excellent telescope for surveys between 700 MHz and 1800 MHz and is expected to facilitate great advances in our understanding of galaxy formation, cosmology and radio transients while opening new parameter space for discovery of the unknown.

##### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01961.pdf)

- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies.
- However, its nucleosynthesis origin and abundance variations are still unclear.
- The goal of the present article is to accurately and precisely study the S-content of large number of stars located in the solar neighbourhood.
- We use the parametrisation of thousands of HR stellar spectra provided by the AMBRE Project, and combine it with the automated abundance determination GAUGUIN to derive LTE sulfur abundances for 1855 slow-rotating FGK-type stars.
- This is the largest and most precise catalogue of S-abundances published to date.
- It covers a metallicity domain as high as ~2.5dex starting at [M/H]~-2.0dex.
- We find that the [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex.
- This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models.
- Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones.
- Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick discs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances.
- The sulfur radial gradients in the Galactic discs have also been estimated.
- Finally, the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated with stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger metal-rich ones.
- This work has confirmed that sulfur is an alfa-element that could be considered to explore the Galactic populations properties.

##### [IDeF-X HD: a CMOS ASIC for the readout of Cd(Zn)Te Detectors for space-borne applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01992) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01992.pdf)

- IDeF-X HD is a 32-channel analog front-end with self-triggering capability optimized for the readout of 16 x 16 pixels CdTe or CdZnTe pixelated detectors to build low power micro gamma camera.
- IDeF-X HD has been designed in the standard AMS CMOS 0.35 microns process technology.
- Its power consumption is 800 micro watt per channel.
- The dynamic range of the ASIC can be extended to 1.1 MeV thanks to the in-channel adjustable gain stage.
- When no detector is connected to the chip and without input current, a 33 electrons rms ENC level is achieved after shaping with 10.7 micro seconds peak time.
- Spectroscopy measurements have been performed with CdTe Schottky detectors.
- We measured an energy resolution of 4.2 keV FWHM at 667 keV (137-Cs) on a mono-pixel configuration.
- Meanwhile, we also measured 562 eV and 666 eV FWHM at 14 keV and 60 keV respectively (241-Am) with a 256 small pixel array and a low detection threshold of 1.2 keV.
- Since IDeF-X HD is intended for space-borne applications in astrophysics, we evaluated its radiation tolerance and its sensitivity to single event effects.
- We demonstrated that the ASIC remained fully functional without significant degradation of its performances after 200 krad and that no single event latch-up was detected putting the Linear Energy Transfer threshold above 110 MeV/(mg/cm2).
- Good noise performance and radiation tolerance make the chip well suited for X-rays energy discrimination and high-energy resolution.
- The chip is space qualified and flies on board the Solar Orbiter ESA mission launched in 2020.

##### [Chameleon dark energy can resolve the Hubble tension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02020) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02020.pdf)

- The values of Hubble constant between the direct measurements from various independent local observations and that inferred from the cosmic microwave background with $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model are in tension with persistent significance.
- In this Letter, we propose a late-time inhomogeneous resolution that a chameleon field coupled to a local overdensity of matter could be trapped at a higher potential energy density as an effective cosmological constant driving the local expansion rate faster than that of the background with lower matter density.
- We illustrate this mechanism in a toy model that a region with only $20\%$ overdensity of matter is sufficient to resolve the Hubble tension, and the Hubble constant measured with the local distance ladders is enhanced by the chameleon coupled to the Great-Wall overdensities discovered in the large scale structure surveys.

##### [Radial structure and formation of the Milky Way disc](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02082) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02082.pdf)

- The formation of the Galactic disc is an enthusiastically debated issue.
- Numerous studies and models seek to identify the dominant physical process(es) that shaped its observed properties.
- Taking advantage of the improved coverage of the inner Milky Way provided by the SDSS DR16 APOGEE catalogue and of the ages published in the APOGEE-AstroNN Value Added Catalogue (VAC), we examine the radial evolution of the chemical and age properties of the Galactic stellar disc, with the aim to better constrain its formation.
- Using a sample of 199,307 giant stars with precise APOGEE abundances and APOGEE-astroNN ages, selected in a +/-2 kpc layer around the galactic plane, we assess the dependency with guiding radius of: (i) the median metallicity, (ii) the ridge lines of the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] and age-[Mg/Fe] distributions and (iii) the Age Distribution Function (ADF).
- The giant star sample allows us to probe the radial behaviour of the Galactic disc from Rg = 0 to 14-16 kpc.
- The thick disc [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] ridge lines follow closely grouped parallel paths, supporting the idea that the thick disc did form from a well-mixed medium.
- However, the ridge lines present a small drift in [Mg/Fe], which decreases with increasing guiding radius.
- At sub-solar metallicity, the intermediate and outer thin disc [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] ridge lines follow parallel sequences shifted to lower metallicity as the guiding radius increases.
- We interpret this pattern, as the signature of a dilution of the inter-stellar medium from Rg~6 kpc to the outskirt of the disc, which occured before the onset of the thin disc formation.
- The APOGEE-AstroNN VAC provides stellar ages for statistically significant samples of thin disc stars from the Galactic centre up to Rg~14 kpc.
- An important result provided by this dataset, is that the thin disc presents evidence of an inside-out formation up to R_g~10-12 kpc.

##### [Lost in the Log-Polynomial Expansion: Comment on arXiv:2101.08278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02098) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02098.pdf)

- In [1] we highlighted the fact that the log polynomial expansion employed in Nature Astron.
- 3, no.3, 272-277 (2019) [2] is a poor approximation to flat $\Lambda$CDM, so using it to infer deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM is not well-motivated.
- The "orthogonalized logarithmic polynomials" recently presented in arXiv:2101.08278 [3] are an attempt to respond to the earlier criticism [1].
- Here we demonstrate that this new technique [3] - interesting though it may be - fails to address the fundamental problem raised in [1].
- Unfortunately, the claim made in [2] may still be lost in the expansion.

- The Simons Observatory (SO) will be a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment with three small-aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope, which will observe from the Atacama Desert in Chile.
- In total, SO will field over 60,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz in order to achieve the sensitivity necessary to measure or constrain numerous cosmological quantities, as outlined in The Simons Observatory Collaboration et al.
- (2019).
- The 6~m Large Aperture Telescope (LAT), which will target the smaller angular scales of the CMB, utilizes a cryogenic receiver (LATR) designed to house up to 13 individual optics tubes.
- Each optics tube is comprised of three silicon lenses, IR blocking filters, and three dual-polarization, dichroic TES detector wafers.
- The scientific objectives of the SO project require these optics tubes to achieve high-throughput optical performance while maintaining exquisite control of systematic effects.
- We describe the integration and testing program for the SO LATR optics tubes that will verify the design and assembly of the optics tubes before they are shipped to the SO site and installed in the LATR cryostat.
- The program includes a quick turn-around test cryostat that is used to cool single optics tubes and validate the cryogenic performance and detector readout assembly.
- We discuss the optical design specifications the optics tubes must meet to be deployed on sky and the suite of optical test equipment that is prepared to measure these requirements.

##### [3D Modelling and Visualisation of Observed Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02141) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02141.pdf)

- Observational astronomers survey the sky in great detail to gain a better understanding of many types of astronomical phenomena.
- In particular, the formation and evolution of galaxies, including our own, is a wide field of research in astronomy.
- Three dimensional (spatial) scientific visualisation is typically limited to simulated galaxies, due to the inherently two dimensional spatial resolution of Earth-based observations.
- We present a novel approach to reconstruct and visualise 3D representations of galaxies based on observational data, using the scientific visualisation software Splotch to generate high quality visual representations that provide a new perspective of galaxies nearby the Milky Way.

##### [AlFoCS + F3D II: unexpectedly low gas-to-dust ratios in the Fornax galaxy cluster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02148) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02148.pdf)

- We combine observations from ALMA, ATCA, MUSE, andHerschel to study gas-to-dust ratios in 15 Fornax cluster galaxies detected in the FIR/sub-mm by Herschel and observed by ALMA as part of the ALMA Fornax Cluster Survey (AlFoCS).
- The sample spans a stellar mass range of 8.3 $\leq$ log (M$_*$ / M$_\odot$) $\leq$ 11.16, and a variety of morphological types.
- We use gas-phase metallicities derived from MUSE observations (from the Fornax3D survey) to study these ratios as a function of metallicity, and to study dust-to-metal ratios, in a sub-sample of nine galaxies.
- We find that gas-to-dust ratios in Fornax galaxies are systematically lower than those in field galaxies at fixed stellar mass/metallicity.
- This implies that a relatively large fraction of the metals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly due to altered chemical evolution as a result of the dense environment.
- The low ratios are not only driven by HI deficiencies, but H$_2$-to-dust ratios are also significantly decreased.
- This is different in the Virgo cluster, where low gas-to-dust ratios inside the virial radius are driven by low HI-to-dust ratios, while H$_2$-to-dust ratios are increased.
- Resolved observations of NGC1436 show a radial increase in H$_2$-to-dust ratio, and show that low ratios are present throughout the disc.
- We propose various explanations for the low H$_2$-to-dust ratios in the Fornax cluster, including the more efficient stripping of H$_2$ compared to dust, more efficient enrichment of dust in the star formation process, and altered ISM physics in the cluster environment.
