##### [Spatial and orbital planes of the Milky Way satellites: unusual but consistent with $\Lambda$CDM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02714) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02714.pdf)

- We examine the spatial distribution and orbital pole correlations of satellites in a suite of zoom-in high-resolution dissipationless simulations of Miky Way (MW) sized haloes.
- We use the measured distribution to estimate the incidence of satellite configurations as flattened and as correlated in their orbital pole distribution as satellite system of the Milky Way.
- We confirm that this incidence is sensitive to the radial distribution of subhaloes and thereby to the processes that affect it, such as artificial disruption due to numerical effects and disruption due to the central disk.
- Controlling for the resolution effects and bracketing the effects of the disk, we find that the MW satellite system is somewhat unusual (at the $\approx 2-3\sigma$level) but is statistically consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, in general agreement with results and conclusions of other recent studies.

##### [A MUSE view of the massive merging galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 (El Gordo) at z = 0.87: robust strong lensing model and data release](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02718) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02718.pdf)

- We present a detailed strong lensing analysis of the massive and distant ($z=0.870$) galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102$-$4915 (ACT0102, also known as El Gordo), taking advantage of new spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, and archival imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope.
- Thanks to the MUSE data, we measure secure redshifts for 374 single objects, including 23 multiply lensed galaxies, and 167 cluster members of ACT0102.
- The observed positions of 56 multiple images, along with their new spectroscopic redshift measurements, are used as constraints for our strong lensing model.
- Remarkably, some multiple images are detected out to a large projected distance of $\approx 1$Mpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, allowing us to estimate a projected total mass value of $1.84_{-0.04}^{+0.03} \times 10^{15} \rm M_{\odot}$within that radius.
- We find that we need two extended cluster mass components, the mass contributions from the cluster members and the additional lensing effect of a foreground ($z=0.633$) group of galaxies, to predict the positions of all multiple images with a root mean square offset of $0.75"$.
- The main cluster-scale mass component is centered very closely to the brightest cluster galaxy and the other extended mass component is located in the north-west region of the cluster.
- These two mass components have very similar values of mass projected within 300 kpc from their centers, namely $2.29_{-0.10}^{+0.09}\times10^{14} \rm M_{\odot}$and $2.10_{-0.09}^{+0.08}\times10^{14} \rm M_{\odot}$, in agreement with the major merging scenario of ACT0102.
- We make publicly available the lens model, including the magnification maps and posterior distributions of the model parameter values, as well as the full spectroscopic catalogue containing all redshift measurements obtained with MUSE.

##### [The Poor Old Heart of the Milky Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02722) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02722.pdf)

- Massive disk galaxies like our Milky Way should host an ancient, metal-poor, and centrally concentrated stellar population.
- This population reflects the star formation and enrichment in the few most massive progenitor components that coalesced at high redshift to form the proto-Galaxy.
- While metal-poor stars are known to reside in the inner few kiloparsecs of our Galaxy, current data do not yet provide a comprehensive picture of such a metal-poor "heart" of the Milky Way.
- We use information from Gaia DR3, especially the XP spectra, to construct a sample of 2 million bright (BP $<15.5$mag) giant stars within $30^\circ$of the Galactic Center with robust [M/H] estimates, $\delta$[M/H] $\lesssim 0.1$.
- For most sample members we can calculate orbits based on Gaia RVS velocities and astrometry.
- This sample reveals an extensive, ancient, and metal-poor population that includes $\sim 18,000$stars with $-2.7<$[M/H] $<-1.5$, representing a stellar mass of $\gtrsim 5\times 10^7$M$_\odot$.
- The spatial distribution of these [M/H] $<-1.5$stars has a Gaussian extent of only $\sigma_{\mathrm{R_{GC}}} \sim 2.7$kpc around the Galactic center, with most of these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy.
- At high orbital eccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in their pericentral orbit phase.
- Stars with [M/H] $< -2$show no net rotation, whereas those with [M/H] $\sim -1$are rotation dominated.
- Most of the tightly bound stars show $[\alpha/\text{Fe}]$-enhancement and [Al/Fe]-[Mn/Fe] abundance patterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of the proto-Galaxy.
- These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldest part of the disk ($\tau_{\text{age}}\approx 12.5$Gyrs), which implies that they formed at $z\gtrsim 5$, forging the proto-Milky Way.

##### [A Generative Model for Quasar Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02725) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02725.pdf)

- We build a multi-output generative model for quasar spectra and the properties of their black hole engines, based on a Gaussian process latent-variable model.
- This model treats every quasar as a vector of latent properties such that the spectrum and all physical properties of the quasar are associated with non-linear functions of those latent parameters; the Gaussian process kernel functions define priors on the function space.
- Our generative model is trained with a justifiable likelihood function that allows us to treat heteroscedastic noise and missing data correctly, which is crucial for all astrophysical applications.
- It can predict simultaneously unobserved spectral regions, as well as the physical properties of quasars in held-out test data.
- We apply the model to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical quasar spectra for which precise black hole masses (based on reverberation mapping measurements) are available.
- Unlike reverberation-mapping studies, which require multi-epoch data, our model predicts black hole masses from single-epoch spectra, even with limited spectral coverage.
- We demonstrate the capabilities of the model by predicting black hole masses and unobserved spectral regions.
- We find that we predict black hole masses at close to the best possible accuracy.

##### [Shaken, not blown: the gentle baryonic feedback of nearby starburst dwarf galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02726) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02726.pdf)

- Baryonic feedback is expected to play a key role in regulating the star formation of low-mass galaxies by producing galaxy-scale winds associated with mass-loading factors $\beta\!\sim\!1\!-\!50$.
- We have tested this prediction using a sample of 19 nearby systems with stellar masses $10^7\!<\!M_\star/{\rm M}_{\odot}\!<\!10^{10}$, mostly lying above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies.
- We used MUSE@VLT optical integral field spectroscopy to study the warm ionised gas kinematics of these galaxies via a detailed modelling of their H$\alpha$emission line.
- The ionised gas is characterised by irregular velocity fields, indicating the presence of non-circular motions of a few tens of km/s within galaxy discs, but with intrinsic velocity dispersion of $40$-$60$km/s that are only marginally larger than those measured in main-sequence galaxies.
- Galactic winds, defined as gas at velocities larger than the galaxy escape speed, encompass only a few percent of the observed fluxes.
- Mass outflow rates and loading factors are strongly dependent on $M_\star$, star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density and specific SFR.
- For $M_\star$of $10^8$M$_\odot$we find $\beta\simeq0.02$, which is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the values predicted by theoretical models of galaxy evolution.
- In our galaxy sample, baryonic feedback stimulates a gentle gas cycle rather than causing a large-scale blow out.

##### [BASS XXXVI: Constraining the Local Supermassive Black Hole - Halo Connection with BASS DR2 AGN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02728) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02728.pdf)

- We investigate the connection between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host dark matter halos in the local universe using the clustering statistics and luminosity function of AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey (BASS DR2).
- By forward-modeling AGN activity into snapshot halo catalogs from N-body simulations, we test a scenario in which SMBH mass correlates with dark matter (sub)halo mass for fixed stellar mass.
- We compare this to a model absent of this correlation, where stellar mass alone determines the SMBH mass.
- We find that while both simple models are able to largely reproduce the abundance and overall clustering of AGN, the model in which black hole mass is tightly correlated with halo mass is preferred by the data by $1.8\sigma$.
- When including an independent measurement on the black hole mass-halo mass correlation, this model is preferred by $4.6\sigma$.
- We show that the clustering trends with black hole mass can further break the degeneracies between the two scenarios, and that our preferred model reproduces the measured clustering differences on 1-halo scales between large and small black hole masses.
- These results indicate that the halo binding energy is fundamentally connected to the growth of supermassive black holes.

##### [HubPUG: Proper Motions for Local Group Dwarfs observed with HST utilizing Gaia as a Reference Frame](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02751) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02751.pdf)

- We present the method behind HubPUG, a software tool built for recovering systemic proper motions (PMs) of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields with two epochs of observations by utilizing stars observed by Gaia as a foreground frame of reference.
- HST PM experiments have typically relied on the use of distant background galaxies or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) as stationary sources against which to measure PMs.
- Without consistent profiles, background galaxies are more difficult to centroid, but benefit on-aggregate from their large numbers.
- QSOs, though they can be fit with stellar point-spread functions, are sparse, with most fields containing none.
- Historically, the use of stars as references against which to measure PMs would have been difficult because they have individual PMs of their own.
- However, Gaia has now provided positions and PMs for over 1.4 billion stars, which are much more likely to be well-imaged in the fields around targets versus background sources, have predictable stellar profiles, and require less observing time per-image for good signal-to-noise.
- This technique allows us to utilize the power of Gaia to measure the PM of targets too faint for Gaia to observe itself.
- We have recovered PMs for the Milky Way satellites Sculptor and Draco with comparable uncertainties over HST-only and Gaia-only measurements, limited primarily by the current capabilities of the Gaia data.
- We also show the promise of this method for satellites of M31 with a new PM measurement for Andromeda VII.

##### [Classifying Transients Using Host Galaxy Photometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02784) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02784.pdf)

- The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will discover tens of thousands of extragalactic transients each night.
- The high volume of alerts demands immediate classification of transient types in order to prioritize observational follow-ups before events fade away.
- We use host galaxy features to classify transients, thereby providing classification upon discovery.
- In contrast to past work that focused on distinguishing Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) using host galaxy features that are not always accessible (e.g., morphology), we determine the relative likelihood across $12$transient classes based on only 19 host apparent magnitudes and colors from $10$optical and IR photometric bands.
- We develop both binary and multiclass classifiers, using kernel density estimation to estimate the underlying distribution of host galaxy properties for each transient class.
- Even in this pilot study, and ignoring relative differences in transient class frequencies, we distinguish eight transient classes at purities significantly above the 8.3% baseline (based on a classifier that assigns labels uniformly and at random): tidal disruption events ($48\%\pm27\%$, where $\pm$indicates the 95% confidence limit), SNe Ia-91bg ($32\%\pm18\%$), SNe Ia-91T ($23\%\pm11\%$), SNe Ib ($23\%\pm13\%$), SNe II ($17\%\pm2\%$), SNe IIn ($17\%\pm6\%$), SNe II P ($16\%\pm4\%$), and SNe Ia ($10\%\pm1\%$).
- We demonstrate that our model is applicable to LSST and estimate that our approach may accurately classify 59% of LSST alerts expected each year for SNe Ia, Ia-91bg, II, Ibc, SLSN-I, and tidal disruption events.
- Our code and dataset are publically available.

##### [PHANGS: Constraining Star Formation Timescales Using the Spatial Correlations of Star Clusters and Giant Molecular Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02872) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02872.pdf)

- In the hierarchical view of star formation, giant molecular gas clouds (GMCs) undergo fragmentation to form small-scale structures made up of stars and star clusters.
- Here we study the connection between young star clusters and cold gas across a range of extragalactic environments by combining the high resolution (1") PHANGS-ALMA catalogue of GMCs with the star cluster catalogues from PHANGS-HST.
- The star clusters are spatially matched with the GMCs across a sample of 11 nearby star-forming galaxies with a range of galactic environments (centres, bars, spiral arms, etc).
- We find that after 4-6 Myr the star clusters are no longer associated with any gas clouds.
- Additionally, we measure the autocorrelation of the star clusters and GMCs as well as their cross-correlation to quantify the fractal nature of hierarchical star formation.
- Young ($\leq$10 Myr) star clusters are more strongly autocorrelated on kpc and smaller spatial scales than the >10 Myr stellar populations, indicating that the hierarchical structure dissolves over time.

##### [TDCOSMO XI. Automated Modeling of 9 Strongly Lensed Quasars and Comparison Between Lens Modeling Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03094) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03094.pdf)

- To use strong gravitational lenses as an astrophysical or cosmological probe, models of their mass distributions are often needed.
- We present a new, time-efficient automation code for uniform modeling of strongly lensed quasars with GLEE, a lens modeling software, for high-resolution multi-band data.
- By using the observed positions of the lensed quasars and the spatially extended surface brightness distribution of the lensed quasar host galaxy, we obtain a model of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy.
- We apply this uniform modeling pipeline to a sample of nine strongly lensed quasars with HST WFC 3 images.
- The models show in most cases well reconstructed light components and a good alignment between mass and light centroids.
- We find that the automated modeling code significantly reduces the user input time during the modeling process.
- The preparation time of required input files is reduced significantly.
- This automated modeling pipeline can efficiently produce uniform models of extensive lens system samples which can be used for further cosmological analysis.
- A blind test through a comparison with the results of an independent automated modeling pipeline based on the modeling software Lenstronomy reveals important lessons.
- Quantities such as Einstein radius, astrometry, mass flattening and position angle are generally robustly determined.
- Other quantities depend crucially on the quality of the data and the accuracy of the PSF reconstruction.
- Better data and/or more detailed analysis will be necessary to elevate our automated models to cosmography grade.
- Nevertheless, our pipeline enables the quick selection of lenses for follow-up monitoring and further modeling, significantly speeding up the construction of cosmography-grade models.
- This is an important step forward to take advantage of the orders of magnitude increase in the number of lenses expected in the coming decade.
