##### [Extreme-ultraviolet bursts and nanoflares in the quiet-Sun transition region and corona](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00730) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00730.pdf)

- The quiet solar corona consists of myriads of loop-like features, with magnetic fields originating from network and internetwork regions on the solar surface.
- The continuous interaction between these different magnetic patches leads to transient brightenings or bursts that might contribute to the heating of the solar atmosphere.
- However, it remains unclear whether such transients, which are mostly observed in the EUV, play a significant role in atmospheric heating.
- We revisit the open question of these bursts as a prelude to the new high-resolution EUV imagery expected from the recently launched Solar Orbiter.
- We use EUV images recorded by the SDO/AIA to investigate statistical properties of the bursts.
- We detect the bursts in the 171 {\AA} filter images of AIA in an automated way through a pixel-wise analysis by imposing different intensity thresholds.
- By exploiting the high cadence (12 s) of the AIA observations, we find that the distribution of lifetimes of these events peaks at about 120 s. The sizes of the detected bursts are limited by the spatial resolution, which indicates that a larger number of events might be hidden in the AIA data.
- We estimate that about 100 new bursts appear per second on the whole Sun.
- The detected bursts have nanoflare-like energies of $10^{24}$ erg per event.
- Based on this, we estimate that at least 100 times more events of a similar nature would be required to account for the energy that is required to heat the corona.
- When AIA observations are considered alone, the EUV bursts discussed here therefore play no significant role in the coronal heating of the quiet Sun.
- If the coronal heating of the quiet Sun is mainly bursty, then the high-resolution EUV observations from Solar Orbiter may be able to reduce the deficit in the number of EUV bursts seen with SDO/AIA at least partly by detecting more such events.

##### [The Flare and Warp of the Young Stellar Disk traced with LAMOST DR5 OB-type stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00731) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00731.pdf)

- We present analysis of the spatial density structure for the outer disk from 8$-$14 kpc with the LAMOST DR5 13534 OB-type stars.
- We discover the clear and similar flaring signatures beyond 8 kpc for which the scale height is from 0.14 to 0.5 kpc in the north and south side, implying that the flaring is possibly symmetrical in the Milky Way disk.
- We reveal that the thickness of the OB stellar disk is similar with our previous thin disk traced by red giant branch stars, possibly implying that secular evolution is not the main contributor to the flaring but other scenarios such as interactions with passing dwarf galaxies should be more possible.
- When comparing the OB stellar disk with the gas disk, the former one is moderately thicker than the later one, meaning that one could tentatively use young OB-type stars to trace the gas properties.
- Meanwhile, we unravel that the scale length of the young OB stellar disk is 1.17 $\pm$ 0.05 kpc, which is shorter than gas disk, comfirming that the gas disk is more extended than stellar disk.
- What is more, by considering the mid-plane displacements ($Z_{0}$) in our density model we find that almost all are within 100 pc with the increasing trend as Galactocentric distance increases, which looks like the warp signal in young stellar population but the scenarios will need to be investigated in more detail.

##### [Proposal of a gauge-invariant treatment of the l=0,1-mode perturbations on Schwarzschild Background Spacetime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00830) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00830.pdf)

- A gauge-invariant treatment of the monopole- ($l=0$) and dipole ($l=1$) modes in the linear perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime is proposed.
- Through this gauge-invariant treatment, we derived the solutions to the linearized Einstein equation for these mode with generic matter field.
- In vacuum case, these solutions include the Kerr parameter perturbations in the $l=1$ odd-modes and the additional mass parameter perturbations of Schwarzschild mass in the $l=0$ even-modes.
- The linearized version of the Birkhoff theorem is also confirmed in the gauge-invariant manner.
- In this sense, our proposal is reasonable.

##### [Search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of sub-solar mass and eccentric compact binaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00868) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00868.pdf)

- We present the first search for gravitational waves from sub-solar mass compact-binary mergers which allows for non-negligible orbital eccentricity.
- Sub-solar mass black holes are a signature of primordial origin black holes, which may be a component of dark matter.
- To produce binary coalescences, primordial black holes may form close binaries either in the early universe or more recently through dynamical interactions.
- A signature of dynamical formation would be the observation of non-circularized orbits.
- We search for black hole mergers where the primary mass is $0.1-7 M_{\odot}$ and the secondary mass is $0.1-1 M_{\odot}$.
- We allow for eccentricity up to $\sim0.3$ at a dominant-mode gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz for binaries with at least one component with mass $>0.5 M_{\odot}$.
- We find no convincing candidates in the public LIGO data.
- The two most promising candidates have a false alarm rate of 1 per 3 and 4 years, respectively, which combined is only a $\sim 2.4\sigma$ deviation from the expected Poisson rate.
- Given the marginal statistical significance, we place upper limits on the rate of sub-solar mass mergers under the assumption of a null observation and compare how these limits may inform the possible dark matter contribution.

##### [Metal-poor Stars Observed with the Automated Planet Finder Telescope. III. CEMP-no Stars are the Descendant of Population\,III Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01076) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01076.pdf)

- In this study, we report a probabilistic insight into the stellar mass and supernovae (SNe) explosion energy of the possible progenitors of five CEMP-no stars.
- This was done by a direct comparison between the abundance ratios [X/Fe] of the light-elements and the predicted nucleosynthetic yields of SN of high-mass metal-free stars.
- This comparison suggests possible progenitors with stellar mass range of 11 - 22 M$_{\odot}$ and explosion energies of $0.3 - 1.8 \times 10^{51}$ erg.
- The coupling of the chemical abundances with kinematics derived from $Gaia$ DR2 suggests that our sample do not enter the outer-halo region.
- In addition, we suggest that these CEMP-no stars are not $Gaia$-Sausage nor $Gaia$-Sequoia remnant stars, but another accretion event might be responsible for the contribution of these stars to the Galactic Halo of the Milky-Way.

##### [A Note on Planet Size and Cooling Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01077) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01077.pdf)

- Variation in the balance of forces that drive and resist tectonic plate motions allows small terrestrial planet to cooler slower than larger ones.
- Given that interior cooling affects surface environment, through volcanic/geologic activity, this indicates that small planets should not be down-weighted in the search for life beyond Earth.

##### [A Measurement of Stellar Surface Gravity Hidden in Radial Velocity Differences of Co-moving Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01079) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01079.pdf)

- The gravitational redshift induced by stellar surface gravity is notoriously difficult to measure for non-degenerate stars, since its amplitude is small in comparison with the typical Doppler shift induced by stellar radial velocity.
- In this study, we make use of the large observational data set of the Gaia mission to achieve a significant reduction of noise caused by these random stellar motions.
- By measuring the differences in velocities between the components of pairs of co-moving stars and wide binaries, we are able to statistically measure gravitational redshift and nullify the effect of the peculiar motions of the stars.
- For the subset of stars considered in this study, we find a positive correlation between the observed differences in Gaia radial velocities and the differences in surface gravity inferred from effective temperature and luminosity measurements.
- This corresponds to the first ever measurement of extra-Solar surface gravity induced gravitational redshift in non-degenerate stars.
- Additionally, we study the sub-dominant effects of convective blueshifting of emission lines, effects of binary motion, and possible systematic errors in radial velocity measurements within Gaia.
- Results from the technique presented in this study are expected to improve significantly with data from the next Gaia data release.
- Such improvements could be used to constrain the mass-luminosity relation and stellar models which predict the magnitude of convective blueshift.

##### [On a Possible Solution to the Tidal Realignment Problem for Hot Jupiters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01081) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01081.pdf)

- Hot stars with hot Jupiters have a wide range of obliquities, while cool stars with hot Jupiters tend to have low obliquities.
- An enticing explanation for this pattern is tidal realignment of the cool host stars, but this explanation requires that obliquity damping occurs faster than orbital decay, which is unclear.
- Here we revisit this tidal realignment problem, building on previous work identifying a low-frequency component of the time-variable tidal potential that affects the obliquity but not the orbital separation.
- We adopt a recent empirically-based model for the stellar tidal quality factor and its sharp increase with forcing frequency.
- This leads to enhanced dissipation at low frequencies, and efficient obliquity damping.
- We model the tidal evolution of 46 observed hot Jupiters orbiting cool stars.
- A key parameter is the stellar age, which we determine in a homogeneous manner for the sample, taking advantage of Gaia DR2 data.
- We explore a variety of tidal histories and futures for each system, finding in most cases that the stellar obliquity is successfully damped before the planet is destroyed.
- A testable prediction of our model is that hot-Jupiter hosts with orbital periods shorter than 2-3 days should have obliquities much smaller than $1^\circ$.
- With the possible exception of WASP-19b, the predicted future lifetimes of the planets range from $10^8$ yr to more than $10^{10}$ yr.
- Thus, these hot Jupiters are probably not in immediate danger of being devoured by their host stars.

##### [Dark matter from an even lighter QCD axion: trapped misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01082) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01082.pdf)

- We show that dark matter can be accounted for by an axion that solves the strong CP problem, but is much lighter than usual due to a $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry.
- The whole mass range from the canonical QCD axion down to the ultra-light regime is allowed, with $3\le\mathcal{N}\lesssim65$.
- This includes the first proposal of a "fuzzy dark matter" QCD axion with $m_a\sim10^{-22}$ eV.
- A novel misalignment mechanism occurs --{\it trapped misalignment}-- due to the peculiar temperature dependence of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ axion potential.
- The dark matter relic density is enhanced because the axion field undergoes two stages of oscillations: it is first trapped in the wrong minimum, which effectively delays the onset of true oscillations.
- Trapped misalignment is more general than the setup discussed here, and may hold whenever an extra source of Peccei-Quinn breaking appears at high temperatures.
- Furthermore, it will be shown that trapped misalignment can dynamically source the recently proposed kinetic misalignment mechanism.
- All the parameter space is within tantalizing reach of the experimental projects for the next decades.
- For instance, even Phase I of CASPEr-Electric could discover this axion.

##### [Catalog-free modeling of galaxy types in deep images: Massive dimensional reduction with neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01086) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01086.pdf)

- Current models of galaxy evolution are constrained by the analysis of catalogs containing the flux and size of galaxies extracted from multiband deep fields carrying inevitable observational and extraction-related biases which can be highly correlated.
- In practice, taking all of these effects simultaneously into account is difficult, and derived models are inevitably biased.
- To address this issue, we use robust likelihood-free methods for the inference of luminosity function parameters, made possible via massive compression of multiband images using artificial neural networks.
- This technique makes the use of catalogs unnecessary when comparing observed and simulated multiband deep fields and constraining model parameters.
- A forward modeling approach generates galaxies of multiple types depending on luminosity function parameters and paints them on photometric multiband deep fields including both the instrumental and observational characteristics.
- The simulated and the observed images present the same selection effects and can therefore be properly compared.
- We train a fully-convolutional neural network to extract the most model-parameter-sensitive summary statistics out of these realistic simulations, shrinking down the dimensionality of the summary space.
- Finally, using the trained network to compress both observed and simulated deep fields, the model parameter values are constrained through Population Monte Carlo likelihood-free inference.
- Using synthetic photometric multiband deep fields similar to the CFHTLS and D1/D2 deep fields and massively compressing them through the convolutional neural network, we demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and consistency of this new catalog-free inference method.
- We are able to constrain the parameters of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies and our results are fully compatible with the classic catalog extraction approaches.

##### [Scrutinizing FR 0 Radio Galaxies as Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray Source Candidates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01087) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01087.pdf)

- Fanaroff-Riley (FR) 0 radio galaxies compose a new class of radio galaxies, which are usually weaker but much more numerous than the well-established class of FR 1 and FR 2 galaxies.
- The latter classes have been proposed as sources of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies reaching up to ${\sim}10^{20}$ eV.
- Based on this conjecture, the possibility of UHECR acceleration and survival in an FR 0 source environment is examined in this work.
- In doing so, an average spectral energy distribution (SED) based on data from the FR 0 catalog (FR0CAT) is compiled.
- The resulting photon fields are used as targets for UHECRs, which suffer from electromagnetic pair production, photo-disintegration, photo-meson production losses, and synchrotron radiation.
- Multiple mechanisms are discussed to assess the UHECR acceleration probability, including Fermi-I order and gradual shear accelerations, and particle escape from the source region.
- This work shows that in a hybrid scenario, combining Fermi and shear accelerations, FR 0 galaxies can contribute to the observed UHECR flux, as long as $\Gamma_\mathrm{j}\gtrsim 1.6$, where shear acceleration starts to dominate over escape.
- Even in less optimistic scenarios, FR 0s can be expected to contribute to the cosmic-ray flux between the knee and the ankle.
- Our results are relatively robust with respect to the realized magnetic turbulence model and the speed of the accelerating shocks.

##### [VVV CL001: The Most Likely Metal-Poor Surviving Globular Cluster in the Inner Galaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01088) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01088.pdf)

- We present the first high-resolution abundance analysis of the globular cluster VVV~CL001, which resides in a region dominated by high interstellar reddening towards the Galactic Bulge.
- Using \textit{H}-band spectra acquired by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), we identified two potential members of the cluster, and estimate from their Fe I lines that the cluster has an average metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.45$ with an uncertainty due to systematics of 0.24 dex.
- We find that the light-(N), $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si), and Odd-Z (Al) elemental abundances of the stars in VVV~CL001 follow the same trend as other Galactic metal-poor globular clusters.
- This makes VVV~CL001 possibly the most metal-poor globular cluster identified so far within the Sun's galactocentric distance and likely one of the most metal-deficient clusters in the Galaxy after ESO280-SC06.
- Applying statistical isochrone fitting, we derive self-consistent age, distance, and reddening values, yielding an estimated age of $11.9^{+3.12}_{-4.05}$ Gyr at a distance of $8.22^{+1.84}_{-1.93}$ kpc, revealing that VVV~CL001 is also an old GC in the inner Galaxy.
- The Galactic orbit of VVV~CL001 indicates that this cluster lies on a halo-like orbit that appears to be highly eccentric.
- Both chemistry and dynamics support the hypothesis that VVV~CL001 could be an ancient fossil relic left behind by a massive merger event during the early evolution of the Galaxy, likely associated with either the Sequoia or the \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus-Sausage structures.

##### [Milky Way archaeology using RR Lyrae and type II Cepheids I. The Orphan stream in 7D using RR Lyrae stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01090) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01090.pdf)

- We present a chemo-dynamical study of the Orphan stellar stream using a catalog of RR~Lyrae pulsating variable stars for which photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data are available.
- Employing low-resolution spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we determined line-of-sight velocities for individual exposures and derived the systemic velocities of the RR~Lyrae stars.
- In combination with the stars' spectroscopic metallicities and \textit{Gaia} EDR3 astrometry, we investigated the northern part of the Orphan stream.
- In our probabilistic approach, we found 20 single mode RR~Lyrae variables likely associated with the Orphan stream based on their positions, proper motions, and distances.
- The acquired sample permitted us to expand our search to nonvariable stars in the SDSS dataset, utilizing line-of-sight velocities determined by the SDSS.
- We found 54 additional nonvariable stars linked to the Orphan stream.
- The metallicity distribution for the identified red giant branch stars and blue horizontal branch stars is, on average, $-2.13\pm0.05$ dex and $-1.87\pm0.14$ dex, with dispersions of 0.23 and 0.43dex, respectively.
- The metallicity distribution of the RR~Lyrae variables peaks at $-1.80\pm0.06$ dex and a dispersion of 0.25dex.
- Using the collected stellar sample, we investigated a possible link between the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Grus II and the Orphan stream.
- Based on their kinematics, we found that both the stream RR~Lyrae and Grus II are on a prograde orbit with similar orbital properties, although the large uncertainties on the dynamical properties render an unambiguous claim of connection difficult.
- At the same time, the chemical analysis strongly weakens the connection between both.
- We argue that Grus II in combination with the Orphan stream would have to exhibit a strong inverse metallicity gradient, which to date has not been detected in any Local Group system.

##### [Applying the Tremaine-Weinberg Method to Nearby Galaxies: Stellar Mass-Based Pattern Speeds, and Comparisons with ISM Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01091) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01091.pdf)

- We apply the Tremaine-Weinberg method to 19 nearby galaxies using stellar mass surface densities and velocities derived from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, to calculate (primarily bar) pattern speeds ($\Omega_{\rm P}$).
- After quality checks, we find that around half (10) of these stellar mass-based measurements are reliable.
- For those galaxies, we find good agreement between our results and previously published pattern speeds, and use rotation curves to calculate major resonance locations (co-rotation radii and Lindblad resonances).
- We also compare these stellar-mass derived pattern speeds with H$\alpha$ (from MUSE) and CO($J=2{-}1$) emission from the PHANGS-ALMA survey.
- We find that in the case of these clumpy ISM tracers, this method erroneously gives a signal that is simply the angular frequency at a representative radius set by the distribution of these clumps ($\Omega_{\rm clump}$), and that this $\Omega_{\rm clump}$ is significantly different to $\Omega_{\rm P}$ ($\sim$20% in the case of H$\alpha$, and $\sim$50% in the case of CO).
- Thus, we conclude that it is inadvisable to use "pattern speeds" derived from ISM kinematics.
- Finally, we compare our derived pattern speeds and co-rotation radii, along with bar properties, to the global parameters of these galaxies.
- Consistent with previous studies, we find that galaxies with a later Hubble type have a larger ratio of co-rotation radius to bar length, more molecular-gas rich galaxies have higher $\Omega_{\rm P}$, and more bulge-dominated galaxies have lower $\Omega_{\rm P}$.
- Unlike earlier works, however, there are no clear trends between the bar strength and $\Omega_{\rm P}$, nor between the total stellar mass surface density and the pattern speed.

##### [The large-scale distribution of highly ionized metals in IllustrisTNG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01092) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01092.pdf)

- We study the intrinsic large-scale distribution and evolution of seven highly ionized metals in the IllustrisTNG magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation.
- We focus on the fractions of CII, CIV, MgII, NV, NeVIII, OVI, and SiIV in different cosmic web structures (filaments, haloes, and voids) and gas phases (warm-hot intergalactic medium WHIM, hot, diffuse, and condensed gas) from $z=6$ to $z=0$.
- Our analysis provides a new perspective to the understanding of the distribution and evolution of baryons across cosmic time and, in turn, gives new hints in the context of the well known missing baryons problem.
- In this work, the cosmic web components are identified using the local comoving dark matter density, which represents a simple and unique way of mapping baryons on large scales.
- Our results show that MgII and CII are mostly located in condensed gas in haloes in high-density, low-temperature, star-forming regions.
- The mass fractions of CIV and SiIV, on the other hand, show similar evolutionary trends in the different gas phases and cosmic web environments.
- Finally, our findings confirm the notion that OVI, NeVIII, and NV exist mainly in the form of diffuse and WHIM gas located in filaments, suggesting that these ionized metals are good tracers of warm/hot and low-density gas, regions that are likely to contain most of the missing baryons in the local Universe.

##### [Tomography of the unique on-going jet in the planetary nebula NGC 2392](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01093) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01093.pdf)

- Jets (fast collimated outflows) are claimed to be the main shaping agent of the most asymmetric planetary nebula (PNe) as they impinge on the circumstellar material at late stages of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase.
- The first jet detected in a PN was that of NGC 2392, yet there is no available image because its low surface brightness contrast with the bright nebular emission.
- Here we take advantage from the tomographic capabilities of GTC MEGARA high-dispersion integral field spectroscopic observations of the jet in NGC 2392 to gain unprecedented details of its morphology and kinematics.
- The jet of NGC 2392 is found to emanate from the central star, break through the walls of the inner shell of this iconic PN and extend outside the nebula's outermost regions with an S-shaped morphology suggestive of precession.
- At odds with the fossil jets found in mature PNe, the jet in NGC 2392 is currently being collimated and launched.
- The high nebular excitation of NGC 2392, which implies a He$^{++}$/He ionization fraction too high to be attributed to the known effective temperature of the star, has been proposed in the past to hint at the presence of a hot white dwarf companion.
- In conjunction with the hard X-ray emission from the central star, the present-day jet collimation would support the presence of such a double-degenerate system where one component undergoes accretion from a remnant circumbinary disk of the common envelope phase.

##### [Superresolution Reconstruction of Severely Undersampled Point-spread Functions Using Point-source Stacking and Deconvolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01094) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01094.pdf)

- Point-spread function (PSF) estimation in spatially undersampled images is challenging because large pixels average fine-scale spatial information.
- This is problematic when fine-resolution details are necessary, as in optimal photometry where knowledge of the illumination pattern beyond the native spatial resolution of the image may be required.
- Here, we introduce a method of PSF reconstruction where point sources are artificially sampled beyond the native resolution of an image and combined together via stacking to return a finely sampled estimate of the PSF.
- This estimate is then deconvolved from the pixel-gridding function to return a superresolution kernel that can be used for optimally weighted photometry.
- We benchmark against the < 1% photometric error requirement of the upcoming SPHEREx mission to assess performance in a concrete example.
- We find that standard methods like Richardson--Lucy deconvolution are not sufficient to achieve this stringent requirement.
- We investigate a more advanced method with significant heritage in image analysis called iterative back-projection (IBP) and demonstrate it using idealized Gaussian cases and simulated SPHEREx images.
- In testing this method on real images recorded by the LORRI instrument on New Horizons, we are able to identify systematic pointing drift.
- Our IBP-derived PSF kernels allow photometric accuracy significantly better than the requirement in individual SPHEREx exposures.
- This PSF reconstruction method is broadly applicable to a variety of problems and combines computationally simple techniques in a way that is robust to complicating factors such as severe undersampling, spatially complex PSFs, noise, crowded fields, or limited source numbers.

##### [Confirmation of Asymmetric Iron Absorption in WASP-76b with HARPS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01095) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01095.pdf)

- Hot Jupiters are predicted to have hot, clear daysides and cooler, cloudy nightsides.
- Recently, an asymmetric signature of iron absorption has been resolved in the transmission spectrum of WASP-76b using ESPRESSO on ESO's Very large Telescope.
- This feature is interpreted as being due to condensation of iron on the nightside, resulting in a different absorption signature from the evening than from the morning limb of the planet.
- It represents the first time that a chemical gradient has been observed across the surface of a single exoplanet.
- In this work, we confirm the presence of the asymmetric iron feature using archival HARPS data of four transits.
- The detection shows that such features can also be resolved by observing multiple transits on smaller telescopes.
- By increasing the number of planets where these condensation features are detected, we can make chemical comparisons between exoplanets and map condensation across a range of parameters for the first time.

##### [Properties of clumps and filaments around galaxy clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01096) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01096.pdf)

- We report on the possibility of studying the properties of cosmic diffuse baryons by studying self-gravitating clumps and filaments connected to galaxy clusters.
- While filaments are challenging to detect with X-ray observations, the higher density of clumps make them visible and a viable tracer to study the thermodynamical properties of baryons undergoing accretion along cosmic web filaments onto galaxy clusters.
- We developed new algorithms to identify these structures in a set of non-radiative high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters, cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters.
- We show that the density and temperature of clumps are independent of the mass of the cluster where they reside.
- We detected a positive correlation between the filament temperature and the host cluster mass.
- Density and Temperature of clumps and filaments tend to correlate.
- Both decrease moving outward.
- We observe that clumps are hotter, more massive and more luminous if identified closer to the cluster center.
- Clumps and filaments contribute to ~17 (1) per cent of the gas mass (volume) outside R500,c, with clumps contributing a factor of 2 more.
- Especially in the outermost cluster regions (~3*R500,c or beyond) X-ray observations might already have the chance of locating filaments based on the distribution of clumps, and by studying the thermodynamics of diffuse baryons before they are processed by the dynamical interaction with the host intracluster medium.

##### [A novel family of rotating black hole mimickers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01105) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01105.pdf)

- The recent opening of gravitational wave astronomy has shifted the debate about black hole mimickers from a purely theoretical arena to a phenomenological one.
- In this respect, missing a definitive quantum gravity theory, the possibility to have simple, meta-geometries describing in a compact way alternative phenomenologically viable scenarios is potentially very appealing.
- A recently proposed metric by Simpson and Visser is exactly an example of such meta-geometry describing, for different values of a single parameter, different non-rotating black hole mimickers.
- Here, we employ the Newman--Janis procedure to construct a rotating generalisation of such geometry.
- We obtain a stationary, axially symmetric metric that depends on mass, spin and an additional real parameter $\ell$.
- According to the value of such parameter, the metric may represent a rotating traversable wormhole, a rotating regular black hole with one or two horizons, or three more limiting cases.
- By studying the internal and external rich structure of such solutions, we show that the obtained metric describes a family of interesting and simple regular geometries providing viable Kerr black hole mimickers for future phenomenological studies.

##### [The wide-field infrared transient explorer (WINTER)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01109) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01109.pdf)

- The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new infrared time-domain survey instrument which will be deployed on a dedicated 1 meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory.
- WINTER will perform a seeing-limited time domain survey of the infrared (IR) sky, with a particular emphasis on identifying r-process material in binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants detected by LIGO.
- We describe the scientific goals and survey design of the WINTER instrument.
- With a dedicated trigger and the ability to map the full LIGO O4 positional error contour in the IR to a distance of 190 Mpc within four hours, WINTER will be a powerful kilonova discovery engine and tool for multi-messenger astrophysics investigations.
- In addition to follow-up observations of merging binaries, WINTER will facilitate a wide range of time-domain astronomical observations, all the while building up a deep coadded image of the static infrared sky suitable for survey science.
- WINTER's custom camera features six commercial large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors and a tiled optical system which covers a $>$1-square-degree field of view with 90% fill factor.
- The instrument observes in Y, J and a short-H (Hs) band tuned to the long-wave cutoff of the InGaAs sensors, covering a wavelength range from 0.9 - 1.7 microns.
- We present the design of the WINTER instrument and current progress towards final integration at Palomar Observatory and commissioning planned for mid-2021.

##### [Dust Transport in Protoplanetary Disks with Wind-driven Accretion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01110) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01110.pdf)

- It has recently been shown that the inner region of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is governed by wind-driven accretion, and the resulting accretion flow showing complex vertical profiles.
- Such complex flow structures are further enhanced due to the Hall effect, especially when the background magnetic field is aligned with disk rotation.
- We investigate how such flow structures impact global dust transport via Monte-Carlo simulations, focusing on two scenarios.
- In the first scenario, the toroidal magnetic field is maximized in the miplane, leading to accretion and decretion flows above and below.
- In the second scenario, the toroidal field changes sign across the midplane, leading to an accretion flow at the disk midplane, with decretion flows above and below.
- We find that in both cases, the contribution from additional gas flows can still be accurately incorporated into the advection-diffusion framework for vertically-integrated dust transport, with enhanced dust radial diffusion up to an effective $\alpha^{\rm eff}\sim10^{-2}$ for strongly coupled dust, even when background turbulence is weak $\alpha<10^{-4}$.
- Dust radial drift is also modestly enhanced in the second scenario.
- We provide a general analytical theory that accurately reproduces our simulation results, thus establishing a framework to model global dust transport that realistically incorporates vertical gas flow structures.
- We also note that the theory is equally applicable to the transport of chemical species.

##### [Mapping the youngest and most massive stars in the Tarantula nebula with MUSE-NFM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01113) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01113.pdf)

- The evolution of the most massive stars is a puzzle with many missing pieces.
- Statistical analyses are the key to provide anchors to calibrate theory, however performing these studies is an arduous job.
- The state-of-the-art integral field spectrograph MUSE has stirred up stellar astrophysicists who are excited about the capability to take spectra of up to a thousand stars in a single exposure.
- The excitement was even higher with the commissioning of the MUSE narrow-field-mode (NFM) that has demonstrated angular resolutions akin to the Hubble Space Telescope.
- We present the first mapping of the dense stellar core R136 in the Tarantula nebula based on a MUSE-NFM mosaic.
- We aim to deliver the first homogeneous analysis of the most massive stars in the local Universe and to explore the impact of these peculiar objects to the interstellar medium.

##### [Connecting the Light Curves of Type IIP Supernovae to the Properties of their Progenitors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01118) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01118.pdf)

- Observations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) reveal a wealth of information about the dynamics of the supernova ejecta and its composition but reveal very little direct information about the progenitor star.
- Constraining properties of the progenitor and the explosion, such as explosion energy, requires coupling the observations with a theoretical model of the explosion.
- Here, we use a new model for driving turbulence-aided neutrino-driven core-collapse supernovae in 1D (STIR) which contains a non-parametric treatment of the neutrino transport while also accounting for turbulence and convection.
- We couple this with the SuperNova Explosion Code to produce bolometric light curves from a landscape of CCSNe driven from self-consistent CCSN simulations with robust neutrino transport.
- We compare our results to several well observed bolometric light curves of Type IIP CCSNe and find that our best fitting models differ from those found in previous studies using thermal bomb explosions, indicating ZAMS masses as much as about 10M$_{\odot}$ greater than previous studies.
- Using our large sample of 136 self-consistent CCSN explosions, we explore correlations between observable features of the light curves and properties of the progenitor star.
- Among other significant correlations, we find a robust linear relationship between light curve plateau luminosity and the iron core mass of the progenitor.
- This relationship allows for properties of the core of the progenitor to be constrained for the first time from photometry alone.

##### [Reconstructing wormhole solutions in curvature based Extended Theories of Gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01123) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01123.pdf)

- Static and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions can be reconstructed in the framework of curvature based Extended Theories of Gravity.
- In particular, extensions of the General Relativity, in metric and curvature formalism give rise to modified gravitational potentials, constituted by the classical Newtonian potential and Yukawa-like corrections, whose parameters can be, in turn, gauged by the observations.
- Such an approach allows to reconstruct the spacetime out of the wormhole throat considering the asymptotic flatness as a physical property for the related gravitational field.
- Such an argument can be applied for a large class of curvature theories characterising the wormholes through the parameters of the potentials.
- According to this procedure, possible wormhole solutions could be observationally constrained.
- On the other hand, stable and traversable wormholes could be a direct probe for this class of Extended Theories of Gravity.

##### [Revisiting the Planet Mass and Stellar Metallicity Relation for Low-Mass Exoplanets Orbiting GKM Class Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01125) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01125.pdf)

- The growing database of exoplanets have shown us the statistical characteristics of various exoplanet populations, providing insight towards their origins.
- Observational evidence suggests that the process by which gas giants are conceived in the stellar disk may be disparate from that of smaller planets.
- Using NASA's Exoplanet Archive, we analyzed a correlation between the planet mass and stellar metallicity of low-mass exoplanets (MP < 0.13 MJ) orbiting spectral class G, K, and M stars.
- The correlation suggests an exponential law relationship between the two that is not fully explained by observation biases alone.

##### [Reprocessing of a Green Bank 43-meter Telescope Survey of Unidentified Bright Radio Sources for Pulsars and Radio Bursts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01132) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01132.pdf)

- We have reprocessed a set of observations of 75 bright, unidentified, steep-spectrum polarized radio sources taken with the Green Bank 43-m telescope to find previously undetected sub-millisecond pulsars and radio bursts.
- The (null) results of the first search of these data were reported by Schmidt et al.
- Our reprocessing searched for single pulses out to a dispersion measure (DM) of 1000 pc cm$^{-3}$ which were classified using the Deep Learning based classifier FETCH.
- We also searched for periodicities at a wider range of DMs and accelerations.
- Our search was sensitive to highly accelerated, rapidly rotating pulsars (including sub-millisecond pulsars) in compact binary systems as well as to highly-dispersed impulsive signals, such as fast radio bursts.
- No pulsars or astrophysical burst signals were found in the reprocessing.

##### [How the bar properties affect the induced spiral structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01134) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01134.pdf)

- Stellar bars and spiral arms co-exist and co-evolve in most disc galaxies in the local Universe.
- However, the physical nature of this interaction remains a matter of debate.
- In this work, we present a set of numerical simulations based on isolated galactic models aimed to explore how the bar properties affect the induced spiral structure.
- We cover a large combination of bar properties, including the bar length, axial ratio, mass and rotation rate.
- We use three galactic models describing galaxies with rising, flat and declining rotation curves.
- We found that the pitch angle best correlates with the bar pattern speed and the spiral amplitude with the bar quadrupole moment.
- Our results suggest that galaxies with declining rotation curves are the most efficient forming grand design spiral structure, evidenced by spirals with larger amplitude and pitch angle.
- We also test the effects of the velocity ellipsoid in a subset of simulations.
- We found that as we increase the radial anisotropy, spirals increase their pitch angle but become less coherent with smaller amplitude.

##### [Heightened Faraday Complexity in the inner 1 kpc of the Galactic Centre](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01139) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01139.pdf)

- We have measured the Faraday rotation of 62 extra-galactic background sources in 58 fields using the CSIRO Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with a frequency range of 1.1 - 3.1 GHz with 2048 channels.
- Our sources cover a region $\sim 12 \mathrm{deg} \times 12 \mathrm{deg}$ ($\sim 1 $kpc) around the Galactic Centre region.
- We show that the Galactic Plane for $|l| < 10^\circ$ exhibits large Rotation Measures (RMs) with a maximum |RM| of $1691.2 \pm 4.9 \mathrm{rad} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ and a mean $|\mathrm{RM}| = 219 \pm 42 \mathrm{rad} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$.
- The RMs decrease in magnitude with increasing projected distance from the Galactic Plane, broadly consistent with previous findings.
- We find an unusually high fraction (95\%) of the sources show Faraday complexity consistent with multiple Faraday components.
- We attribute the presences of multiple Faraday rotating screens with widely separated Faraday depths to small-scale turbulent RM structure in the Galactic Centre region.
- The second order structure function of the RM in the Galactic Centre displays a line with a gradient of zero for angular separations spanning $0.83^\circ - 11^\circ$ ($\sim 120 - 1500$ pc), which is expected for scales larger than the outer scale (or driving scale) of magneto-ionic turbulence.
- We place an upper limit on any break in the SF gradient of 66'', corresponding to an inferred upper limit to the outer scale of turbulence in the inner 1 kpc of the Galactic Centre of $3$ pc.
- We propose stellar feedback as the probable driver of this small-scale turbulence.

##### [Drifts of the marginally stable burning frequency in the X-ray binaries 4U 1608--52 and Aql X--1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01181) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01181.pdf)

- We detect millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) using the Rossi X-ray Time Explorer (RXTE) from the atoll neutron-star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1608--52 and Aql X--1.
- From the analysis of all RXTE observations of 4U 1608--52 and Aql X--1, we find mHz QPOs with a significance level $>3\sigma$ in 49 and 47 observations, respectively.
- The QPO frequency is constrained between $\sim$ 4.2 and 13.4 mHz.
- These types of mHz QPOs have been interpreted as being the result of marginally stable nuclear burning of He on the NS surface.
- We also report the discovery of a downward frequency drift in three observations of 4U 1608--52, making it the third source that shows this behaviour.
- We only find strong evidence of frequency drift in one occasion in Aql X--1, probably because the observations were too short to measure a significant drift.
- Finally, the mHz QPOs are mainly detected when both sources are in the soft or intermediate states; the cases that show frequency drift only occur when the sources are in intermediate states.
- Our results are consistent with the phenomenology observed for the NS systems 4U 1636--53 and EXO 0748--676, suggesting that all four sources can reach the conditions for marginally stable burning of He on the NS surface.
- These conditions depend on the source state in the same manner in all four systems.

##### [Cosmological cross-correlations and nearest neighbor distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01184) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01184.pdf)

- Cross-correlations between datasets are used in many different contexts in cosmological analyses.
- Recently, $k$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions ($k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$) were shown to be sensitive probes of cosmological (auto) clustering.
- In this paper, we extend the framework of nearest neighbor measurements to describe joint distributions of, and correlations between, two datasets.
- We describe the measurement of joint $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$s, and show that these measurements are sensitive to all possible connected $N$-point functions that can be defined in terms of the two datasets.
- We describe how the cross-correlations can be isolated by combining measurements of the joint $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$s and those measured from individual datasets.
- We demonstrate the application of these measurements in the context of Gaussian density fields, as well as for fully nonlinear cosmological datasets.
- Using a Fisher analysis, we show that measurements of the halo-matter cross-correlations, as measured through nearest neighbor measurements are more sensitive to the underlying cosmological parameters, compared to traditional two-point cross-correlation measurements over the same range of scales.
- Finally, we demonstrate how the nearest neighbor cross-correlations can robustly detect cross correlations between sparse samples -- the same regime where the two-point cross-correlation measurements are dominated by noise.

##### [A blind ATCA HI survey of the Fornax galaxy cluster: properties of the HI detections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01185) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01185.pdf)

- We present the first interferometric blind HI survey of the Fornax galaxy cluster, which covers an area of 15 deg$^2$ out to the cluster $R_{vir}$.
- The survey has a resolution of 67''x95'' and 6.6 km$s^{-1}$ with a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of N(HI)~2x10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ and MHI 2x10$^7$ M$_\odot$.
- We detect 16 galaxies out of 200 spectroscopically confirmed Fornax cluster members.
- The detections cover ~3 orders of magnitude in HI mass, from 8x10$^6$ to 1.5x10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$.
- They avoid the central, virialised region of the cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, ~2 Gyr.
- Half of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several cases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case of a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have been interacting within or on their way to Fornax.
- Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars at a lower rate than non-cluster galaxies in the same $M_\star$ range.
- Low mass galaxies are more strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster.
- The MHI/$M_\star$ ratio of Fornax galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo cluster.
- At fixed $M_\star$, our HI detections follow the non-cluster relation between MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies that so far they have lost their HI on a timescale $\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr.
- Deeper inside the cluster HI removal is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of HI-undetected but H$_2$-detected star-forming galaxies.
- Based on ALMA data, we find a large scatter in H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies showing an unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal.
- We identify an HI-rich subgroup of possible interacting galaxies dominated by NGC 1365, where pre-processing is likey to have taken place.

##### [Magnetic signatures on mixed-mode frequencies. I. An axisymmetric fossil field inside the core of red giants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01216) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01216.pdf)

- The discovery of the moderate differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars could be the signature of a strong magnetic field trapped inside the radiative interior.
- The population of intermediate-mass red giants presenting a surprisingly low-amplitude of their mixed modes could also arise from the effect of an internal magnetic field.
- Indeed, stars more massive than about 1.1Ms are known to develop a convective core during their main sequence, which could relax into a strong fossil magnetic field trapped inside the core of the star for the rest of its evolution.
- The observations of mixed modes can constitute an excellent probe of the deepest layers of evolved solar-like stars.
- The magnetic perturbation on mixed modes may thus be visible in asteroseismic data.
- To unravel which constraints can be obtained from observations, we theoretically investigate the effects of a plausible mixed axisymmetric magnetic field with various amplitudes on the mixed-mode frequencies of evolved solar-like stars.
- The first-order frequency perturbations are computed for dipolar and quadrupolar mixed modes.
- These computations are carried out for a range of stellar ages, masses, and metallicities.
- We show that typical fossil-field strengths of 0.1-1 MG, consistent with the presence of a dynamo in the convective core during the main sequence, provoke significant asymmetries on mixed-mode frequency multiplets during the red-giant branch.
- We show that these signatures may be detectable in asteroseismic data for field amplitudes small enough for the amplitude of the modes not to be affected by the conversion of gravity into Alfven waves inside the magnetised interior.
- Finally, we infer an upper limit for the strength of the field, and the associated lower limit for the timescale of its action, to redistribute angular momentum in stellar interiors.

##### [A thermophysical and dynamical study of the Hildas (1162) Larissa and (1911) Schubart](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01230) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01230.pdf)

- The Hilda asteroids are among the least studied populations in the asteroid belt, despite their potential importance as markers of Jupiter's migration in the early Solar system.
- We present new mid-infrared observations of two notable Hildas, (1162) Larissa and (1911) Schubart, obtained using the Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST), and use these to characterise their thermal inertia and physical properties.
- For (1162) Larissa, we obtain an effective diameter of \textcolor{black}{46.5$^{+2.3}_{-1.7}$~km, an albedo of 0.12~$\pm$~0.02, and a thermal inertia of 15$^{+10}_{-8}$ Jm$^{-2}$s$^{1/2}$K$^{-1}$.
- In addition, our Larissa thermal measurements are well matched with an ellipsoidal shape with an axis ratio a/b=1.2 for the most-likely spin properties.
- Our modelling of (1911) Schubart is not as refined, but the thermal data point towards a high-obliquity spin-pole, with a best-fit a/b=1.3 ellipsoidal shape.
- This spin-shape solution is yielding a diameter of 72$^{+3}_{-4}$ km, an albedo of 0.039$\pm$~0.02, and a thermal inertia below 30 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{1/2}$K$^{-1}$ (or 10$^{+20}_{-5}$Jm$^{-2}$s$^{1/2}$K$^{-1}$).}
- As with (1162) Larissa, our results suggest that (1911) Schubart is aspherical, and likely elongated in shape.
- Detailed dynamical simulations of the two Hildas reveal that both exhibit strong dynamical stability, behaviour that suggests that they are primordial, rather than captured objects.
- The differences in their albedos, along with their divergent taxonomical classification, suggests that despite their common origin, the two have experienced markedly different histories.

##### [Design and Performance Analysis of a Highly Efficient Polychromatic Full-Stokes Polarization Modulator for the CRISP Imaging Spectrometer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01231) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01231.pdf)

- We present the design and performance of a polychromatic polarization modulator for the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) Fabry-Perot tunable narrow-band imaging spectropolarimer at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST).
- We discuss the design process in depth, compare two possible modulator designs through a tolerance analysis, and investigate thermal sensitivity of the selected design.
- The trade-offs and procedures described in this paper are generally applicable in the development of broadband polarization modulators.
- The modulator was built and has been operational since 2015.
- Its measured performance is close to optimal between 500 and 900~nm, and differences between the design and as-built modulator are largely understood.
- We show some example data, and briefly review scientific work that used data from SST/CRISP and this modulator.

##### [The physics of gas phase metallicity gradients in galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01234) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01234.pdf)

- We present a new model for the evolution of gas phase metallicity gradients in galaxies from first principles.
- We show that metallicity gradients depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration timescale, production, transport, consumption, and loss.
- Our model finds that most galaxy metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts.
- When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web.
- The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies.
- We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations.
- We also predict the evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both matched stellar masses and matched abundances.
- Our model shows that massive galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence.
- Lastly, we show that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be in equilibrium.
- In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.

##### [StrayCats: A catalog of NuSTAR Stray Light Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01236) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01236.pdf)

- We present StrayCats: a catalog of NuSTAR stray light observations of X-ray sources.
- Stray light observations arise for sources 1--4$^{\circ}$ away from the telescope pointing direction.
- At this off-axis angle, X-rays pass through a gap between optics and aperture stop and so do not interact with the X-ray optics but, instead, directly illuminate the NuSTAR focal plane.
- We have systematically identified and examined over 1400 potential observations resulting in a catalog of 436 telescope fields and 78 stray light sources that have been identified.
- The sources identified include historically known persistently bright X-ray sources, X-ray binaries in outburst, pulsars, and Type I X-ray bursters.
- In this paper we present an overview of the catalog and how we identified the StrayCats sources and the analysis techniques required to produce high level science products.
- Finally, we present a few brief examples of the science quality of these unique data.

##### ["A more probable explanation" is still impossible to explain GN-z11-flash: in response to Steinhardt et al. (arXiv:2101.12738)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01239) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01239.pdf)

- In Jiang et al.
- (2020), we reported a possible bright flash (hereafter GN-z11-flash) from a galaxy GN-z11 at z ~ 11.
- Recently, Steinhardt et al.
- (2021; arXiv:2101.12738) found 27 images with transient signals in Keck MOSFIRE archival data and claimed that GN-z11-flash was more likely from a moving object in our Solar system.
- We show that the Steinhardt et al.
- 's definition of the chance probability and their methodology of finding GN-z11-flash-like transients are problematic in several aspects.
- In particular, none of their transients is analogous to GN-z11-flash, and none of them is positionally coincident with a known object in their imaging data.
- In Jiang et al., we performed a comprehensive analysis of the origin of GN-z11-flash and ruled out, to the best of our knowledge, the possibility of known man-made objects or moving objects in the Solar system, based on all available information and our current understanding of these objects.
- Steinhardt et al.
- did not use such information and did not analyse the GN-z11-flash event itself.
- The majority of their transients are apparently low-Earth orbit satellites or aircrafts.
- Therefore, their analysis can neither prove nor disprove our results.
- Finally, we present a method to estimate the chance probability of finding GN-z11-flash-like transients in archival data.
- Based on this method and the archival data used by Steinhardt et al., we obtain a loose upper limit of the probability that actually support the original results of Jiang et al.

##### [Unique achondrite Northwest Africa 11042: Exploring the melting and breakup of the L Chondrite parent body](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01281) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01281.pdf)

- Northwest Africa (NWA) 11042 is a heavily shocked achondrite with medium-grained cumulate textures.
- Its olivine and pyroxene compositions, oxygen isotopic composition, and chromium isotopic composition are consistent with L chondrites.
- Sm-Nd dating of its primary phases shows a crystallization age of 4100 +/- 160 Ma.
- Ar-Ar dating of its shocked mineral maskelynite reveals an age of 484.0 +/- 1.5 Ma.
- This age coincides roughly with the breakup event of the L chondrite parent body evident in the shock ages of many L chondrites and the terrestrial record of fossil L chondritic chromite.
- NWA 11042 shows large depletions in siderophile elements (<0.01 times CI) suggestive of a complex igneous history involving extraction of a Fe-Ni-S liquid on the L chondrite parent body.
- Due to its relatively young crystallization age, the heat source for such an igneous process is most likely impact.
- Because its mineralogy, petrology, and O isotopes are similar to the ungrouped achondrite NWA 4284 (this work), the two meteorites are likely paired and derived from the same parent body.

##### [Using a multi-messenger and multi-wavelength observational strategy to probe the nature of dark energy through direct measurements of cosmic expansion history](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01292) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01292.pdf)

- In the forthcoming decades, the redshift drift observations in optical and radio bands will provide accurate measurements on $H(z)$ covering the redshift ranges of $2<z<5$ and $0<z<1$.
- In addition, gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations could make measurements on the dipole anisotropy of luminosity distance, which will also provide the $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range of $0<z<3$.
- In this work, we propose a multi-messenger and multi-wavelength observational strategy to measure $H(z)$ based on the three next-generation projects, E-ELT, SKA, and DECIGO, and we wish to see whether the future $H(z)$ measurements could provide tight constraints on dark-energy parameters.
- It is found that E-ELT, SKA1, and DECIGO are highly complementary in constraining dark energy models using the $H(z)$ data.
- We find that E-ELT, SKA1, and DECIGO can tightly constrain $\Omega_m$, $w$ (or $w_0$), and $H_0$, respectively, and thus the combination of them could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies.
- The joint E-ELT+SKA1+DECIGO data give $\sigma(w)\approx 0.02$ in the $w$CDM model and $\sigma(w_0)\approx 0.03$ in the CPL model, which are better than the results of {\it Planck} 2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+SNe+BAO.
- But even the joint data cannot well constrain $w_a$ in the CPL model.

##### [Analysis of Lower Hybrid Drift Waves in Kappa Distributions over Solar Atmosphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01323) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01323.pdf)

- Kappa distributions and with loss cone features have been frequently observed with flares emissions with the signatures of Lower hybrid waves.
- We have analysed the plasma with Kappa distributions and with loss cone features for the drift wave instabilities in perpendicular propagation for Large flare and Normal flare and Coronal condition .
- While analysing the growth/damping rate, we understand that the growth of propagation of EM waves increases with kappa distribution index for all the three cases.
- In comparing the propagation large flare shows lesser growth in compared with the normal and the coronal plasmas.
- When added the loss cone features to Kappa distributions, we find that the damping of EM wave propagation takes place.
- The damping rate EM waves is increases with perpendicular temperature and loss cone index l, in all the three cases but damping is very high for large flare and then normal in comparision with coronal condition.
- This shows that the lower hybrid damping may be the source of coronal heating.

##### [Long-term evolution of a merger-remnant neutron star in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics I: Effect of magnetic winding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01346) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01346.pdf)

- Long-term ideal and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations in full general relativity are performed for a massive neutron star formed as a remnant of binary neutron star mergers.
- Neutrino radiation transport effects are taken into account as in our previous papers.
- The simulation is performed in axial symmetry and without considering dynamo effects as a first step.
- In the ideal MHD, the differential rotation of the remnant neutron star amplifies the magnetic-field strength by the winding in the presence of a seed poloidal field until the electromagnetic energy reaches $\sim 10\%$ of the rotational kinetic energy, $E_{\rm kin}$, of the neutron star.
- The timescale until the maximum electromagnetic energy is reached depends on the initial magnetic-field strength and it is $\sim 1$ s for the case that the initial maximum magnetic-field strength is $\sim 10^{15}$ G. After a significant amplification of the magnetic-field strength by the winding, the magnetic braking enforces the initially differentially rotating state approximately to a rigidly rotating state.
- In the presence of the resistivity, the amplification is continued only for the resistive timescale, and if the maximum electromagnetic energy reached is smaller than $\sim 3\%$ of $E_{\rm kin}$, the initial differential rotation state is approximately preserved.
- In the present context, the post-merger mass ejection is induced primarily by the neutrino irradiation/heating and the magnetic winding effect plays only a minor role for the mass ejection.

##### [Heavy element contributions of rotating massive stars to Interstellar Medium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01352) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01352.pdf)

- Employing the the stellar evolution code (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we calculate yields of heavy elements from massive stars via stellar wind and core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) ejecta to interstellar medium (ISM).
- In our models, the initial masses ($M_{\rm ini}$) of massive stars are taken from 13 to 80 $M_\odot$, their initial rotational velocities (V) are 0, 300 and 500 km s$^{-1}$, and their metallicities are [Fe/H] = -3, -2, -1, and 0.
- The yields of heavy elements coming from stellar winds are mainly affected by the stellar rotation which changes the chemical abundances of stellar surfaces via chemically homogeneous evolution, and enhances mass-loss rate.
- We estimate that the stellar wind can produce heavy element yields of about $10^{-2}$ (for low metallicity models) to several $M_\odot$ (for low metallicity and rapid rotation models) mass.
- The yields of heavy element produced by CCSN ejecta also depend on the remnant mass of massive mass which is mainly determined by the mass of CO-core.
- Our models calculate that the yields of heavy elements produced by CCSN ejecta can get up to several $M_\odot$.
- Compared with stellar wind, CCSN ejecta has a greater contribution to the heavy elements in ISM.
- We also compare the $^{56}$Ni yields by calculated in this work with observational estimate.
- Our models only explain the $^{56}$Ni masses produced by faint SNe or normal SNe with progenitor mass lower than about 25 $M_\odot$, and greatly underestimate the $^{56}$Ni masses produced by stars with masses higher than about 30 $M_\odot$.

##### [A Catalog of High-Velocity CIV Mini-BALs in the VLT-UVES and Keck-HIRES Archives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01362) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01362.pdf)

- We present a catalog of high-velocity CIV $\lambda$ 1548,1551 mini-Broad Absorption Lines (mini-BALs) in the archives of the VLT-UVES and Keck-HIRES spectrographs.
- We identify high-velocity CIV mini-BALs based on smooth rounded BAL-like profiles with velocity blueshifts $<$ $-$4000 km/s and widths in the range 70 $\lesssim$ FWHM(1548) $\lesssim$ 2000 km/s (for $\lambda$1548 alone).
- We find 105 mini-BALs in 44 quasars from a total sample of 638 quasars.
- The fraction of quasars with at least one mini-BAL meeting our criteria is roughly $\sim9$% after correcting for incomplete velocity coverage.
- However, the numbers of systems rise sharply at lower velocities and narrower FWHMs, suggesting that many outflow lines are missed by our study.
- All of the systems are highly ionized based on the strong presence of NV and OVI and/or the absence of SiII and CII when within the wavelength coverage.
- Two of the mini-BAL systems in our catalog, plus three others at smaller velocity shifts, have PV $\lambda$1118,1128 absorption indicating highly saturated CIV absorption and total hydrogen column densities $\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$.
- Most of the mini-BALs are confirmed to have optical depths $\gtrsim$1 with partial covering of the quasar continuum source.
- The covering fractions are as small as 0.06 in CIV and 0.03 in SiIV , corresponding to outflow absorbing structures $<0.002$ pc across.
- When multiple lines are measured, the lines of less abundant ions tend to have narrower profiles and smaller covering fractions indicative of inhomogeneous absorbers where higher column densities occur in smaller clumps.
- This picture might extend to BAL outflows if the broader and generally deeper BALs form in either the largest clumps or collections of many mini-BAL-like clumps that blend together in observed quasar spectra.

##### [Cosmological Parameter Estimation from the Two-Dimensional Genus Topology -- Measuring the Expansion History using the Genus Amplitude as a Standard Ruler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01365) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01365.pdf)

- We measure the genus of the galaxy distribution in two-dimensional slices of the SDSS-III BOSS catalog to constrain the cosmological parameters governing the expansion history of the Universe.
- The BOSS catalogs are divided into twelve concentric shells over the redshift range $0.25 < z < 0.6$ and we repeatedly measure the genus from the two-dimensional galaxy density fields, each time varying the cosmological parameters used to infer the distance-redshift relation to the shells.
- We also indirectly reconstruct the two-dimensional genus amplitude using the three-dimensional genus measured from SDSS Main Galaxy Sample with galaxies at low redshift $z < 0.12$.
- We combine the low- and high-redshift measurements, finding the cosmological model which minimizes the redshift evolution of the genus amplitude, using the fact that this quantity should be conserved.
- Being a distance measure, the test is sensitive to the matter density parameter ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) and equation of state of dark energy ($w_{\rm de}$).
- We find a constraint of $w_{\rm de} = -1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.303 \pm 0.036$ after combining the high- and low-redshift measurements and combining with Planck CMB data.
- Higher redshift data and combining data sets at low redshift will allow for stronger constraints.

##### [Magnetic field generation from bubble collisions during first-order phase transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01398) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01398.pdf)

- We study the magnetic fields generation from the cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition.
- We calculate the magnetic field induced by the variation of the Higgs phase for two bubbles and three bubbles collisions.
- Our study shows that electromagnetic currents in the collision direction produce the ring-like magnetic field in the intersect regions of colliding bubbles, which may seed the primordial magnetic field that are constrained by intergalatic field observations.

##### [Dynamical coupling of a mean-field dynamo and its wind: Feedback loop over a stellar activity cycle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01416) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01416.pdf)

- We focus on the connection between the internal dynamo magnetic field and the stellar wind.
- If the star has a cyclic dynamo, the modulations of the magnetic field can affect the wind, which in turn can back-react on the boundary conditions of the star, creating a feedback loop.
- We have developed a 2.5-dimensional numerical set-up to model this essential coupling.
- We have implemented an alpha-Omega mean-field dynamo in the PLUTO code, and then coupled it to a spherical polytropic wind model via an interface composed of four grid layers with dedicated boundary conditions.
- We present here a dynamo model close to a young Sun with cyclic magnetic activity.
- First we show how this model allows to track the influence of the dynamo activity on the corona by displaying the correlation between the activity cycle, the coronal structure and the time evolution of integrated quantities.
- Then we add the feedback of the wind on the dynamo and discuss the changes observed in the dynamo symmetry and the wind variations.
- We explain these changes in terms of dynamo modes : in this parameter regime, the feedback loop leads to a coupling between the dynamo families via a preferred growth of the quadrupolar mode.
- We also study our interface in terms of magnetic helicity, and show that it leads to a small injection in the dynamo.
- This model confirms the importance of coupling physically internal and external stellar layers, as it has a direct impact on both the dynamo and the wind.

- This paper presents a class of exact spherical symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations admitting heat-conducting anisotropic fluid as a collapsing matter.
- The exterior spacetime is assumed to be the Vaidya metric.
- This class of solutions is shown to satisfy all the energy conditions throughout the interior of the star, and the luminosity is time independent, radiating uniformly throughout the collapse.

##### [The dynamics of the globular cluster NGC3201 out to the Jacobi radius](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01472) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01472.pdf)

- As part of a chemo-dynamical survey of five nearby globular clusters with 2dF/AAOmega on the AAT, we have obtained kinematic information for the globular cluster NGC3201.
- Our new observations confirm the presence of a significant velocity gradient across the cluster which can almost entirely be explained by the high proper motion of the cluster.
- After subtracting the contribution of this perspective rotation, we found a remaining rotation signal with an amplitude of $\sim1\ km/s$ around a different axis to what we expect from the tidal tails and the potential escapers, suggesting that this rotation is internal and can be a remnant of its formation process.
- At the outer part, we found a rotational signal that is likely a result from potential escapers.
- The proper motion dispersion at large radii reported by Bianchini et al.
- has previously been attributed to dark matter.
- Here we show that the LOS dispersion between 0.5-1 Jacobi radius is lower, yet above the predictions from an N-body model of NGC3201 that we ran for this study.
- Based on the simulation, we find that potential escapers cannot fully explain the observed velocity dispersion.
- We also estimate the effect on the velocity dispersion of different amounts of stellar-mass black holes and unbound stars from the tidal tails with varying escape rates and find that these effects cannot explain the difference between the LOS dispersion and the N-body model.
- Given the recent discovery of tidal tail stars at large distances from the cluster, a dark matter halo is an unlikely explanation.
- We show that the effect of binary stars, which is not included in the N-body model, is important and can explain part of the difference in dispersion.
- We speculate that the remaining difference must be the result of effects not included in the N-body model, such as initial cluster rotation, velocity anisotropy and Galactic substructure.

##### [Three-dimensional morphological asymmetries in the ejecta of Cassiopeia A using a component separation method in X-rays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01507) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01507.pdf)

- Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNR) can still reflect asymmetries from the initial supernova explosion.
- Thus, their study provides a great means to test and constrain model predictions in relation to the distributions of heavy elements or the neutron star kicks, both of which are key to better understanding the explosion mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae.
- The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the well-known Cassiopeia A SNR has revealed maps of the distribution of the ejecta endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clearly separated from continuum emission.
- Our method also provides a three-dimensional view of the ejecta by disentangling the red- and blue-shifted spectral components and associated images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe, providing insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in Cassiopeia A.
- These mappings allow us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the heavy elements distribution and probe simulation predictions about the neutron star kicks and the relative asymmetries between the different elements.
- We find in our study that most of the ejecta X-ray flux stems from the red-shifted component, suggesting an asymmetry in the explosion.
- In addition, the red-shifted ejecta can physically be described as a broad, relatively symmetric plume, whereas the blue-shifted ejecta is more similar to a dense knot.
- The neutron star also moves directly opposite to the red-shifted parts of the ejecta similar to what is seen with 44Ti.
- Regarding the morphological asymmetries, it appears that heavier elements have more asymmetrical distributions, which confirms predictions made by simulations.
- This study is a showcase of the capacities of new analysis methods to revisit archival observations to fully exploit their scientific content.

##### [Growth of matter perturbations in an interacting dark energy scenario emerging from metric-scalar-torsion couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01525) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01525.pdf)

- We study the growth of linear matter density perturbations in a modified gravity approach of scalar field couplings with metric and torsion.
- In the equivalent scalar-tensor formulation, the matter fields in the Einstein frame interact as usual with an effective dark energy component, whose dynamics is presumably governed by a scalar field that sources a torsion mode.
- As a consequence, the matter density ceases to be self-conserved, thereby making an impact not only on the background cosmological evolution but also on the perturbative spectrum of the local inhomogeneities.
- In order to estimate the effect on the growth of the linear matter perturbations, with the least possible alteration of the standard parametric form of the growth factor, we resort to a suitable Taylor expansion of the corresponding exponent, known as the growth index, about the value of the cosmic scale factor at the present epoch.
- In particular, we obtain an appropriate fitting formula for the growth index in terms of the coupling function and the matter density parameter.
- While the overall parametric formulation of the growth factor is found to fit well with the latest redshift-space-distortion (RSD) and the observational Hubble (OH) data at low redshifts, the fitting formula enables us to constrain the growth index to well within the concordant cosmological limits, thus ensuring the viability of the formalism.

##### [Physical properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies up to redshift 1.80 based on HST data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01557) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01557.pdf)

- Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) have grown by accreting numerous smaller galaxies and can be used as tracers of cluster formation and evolution in the cosmic web.
- However, there is still a controversy on the main epoch of formation of BCGs, since some authors believe they have already formed before redshift z=2, while others still find them to evolve at more recent epochs.
- We aim to analyse the physical properties of a large sample of BCGs covering a wide redshift range up to z=1.8 and analysed in a homogeneous way, to see if their characteristics vary with redshift.
- As a first step, we also present a new tool to define for each cluster which galaxy is the BCG.
- For a sample of 137 clusters with HST images in the optical and/or infrared, we analyse the BCG properties by applying GALFIT with one or two Sersic components.
- For each BCG, we compute the Sersic index, effective radius, major axis position angle, surface brightness.
- We then search for correlations of these quantities with redshift.
- We find that BCGs follow the Kormendy relation (between the effective radius and the mean surface brightness), with a slope that remains constant with redshift, but with a variation with redshift of the ordinate at the origin.
- Although the trends are faint, we find that both the absolute magnitudes and effective radii tend to become respectively brighter and bigger with decreasing redshift.
- On the other hand, we find no significant correlation of the mean surface brightnesses or Sersic indices with redshift.
- The major axes of the cluster elongations and of the BCGs agree within 30 degrees for 73% of our clusters at redshift z <= 0.9.
- Our results agree with the BCGs being mainly formed before redshift z=2.
- The alignment of the major axes of BCGs with their clusters agree with the general idea that BCGs form at the same time as clusters by accreting matter along the filaments of the cosmic web.

##### [Preliminary mission profile of Hera's Milani CubeSat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01559) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01559.pdf)

- CubeSats offer a flexible and low-cost option to increase the scientific and technological return of small-body exploration missions.
- ESA's Hera mission, the European component of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) international collaboration, plans on deploying two CubeSats in the proximity of binary system 65803 Didymos, after arrival in 2027.
- In this work, we discuss the feasibility and preliminary mission profile of Hera's Milani CubeSat.
- The CubeSat mission is designed to achieve both scientific and technological objectives.
- We identify the design challenges and discuss design criteria to find suitable solutions in terms of mission analysis, operational trajectories, and Guidance, Navigation, & Control (GNC) design.
- We present initial trajectories and GNC baseline, as a result of trade-off analyses.
- We assess the feasibility of the Milani CubeSat mission and provide a preliminary solution to cover the operational mission profile of Milani in the close-proximity of Didymos system.

##### [Phase transition gravitational waves from pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter and two Higgs doublets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01588) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01588.pdf)

- We investigate the potential stochastic gravitational waves from first-order electroweak phase transitions in a model with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter and two Higgs doublets.
- The dark matter candidate can naturally evade direct detection bounds, and can achieve the observed relic abundance via the thermal mechanism.
- Three scalar fields in the model obtain vacuum expectation values, related to phase transitions at the early Universe.
- We search for the parameter points that can cause first-order phase transitions, taking into account the existed experimental constraints.
- The resulting gravitational wave spectra are further evaluated.
- Some parameter points are found to induce strong gravitational wave signals, which could be probed by future space-based interferometer experiments LISA, Taiji, and TianQin.

##### [Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner: Water Production Activity over 20 Years with SOHO/SWAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01608) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01608.pdf)

- In 1985 Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner was the first comet visited by a spacecraft, the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) satellite, several months before the armada of Halley spacecraft had their encounters in 1986.
- ICE was originally the ISEE-3 satellite, designed for magnetospheric measurements near the Earth, and was diverted via a lunar gravity assist to pass through the plasma tail of the comet.
- The comet has been observed by the all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) camera on the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite during its last four apparitions in 1998, 2005, 2012 and 2018.
- This paper compares water production rates calculated from the hydrogen images from the 1998 and 2005 results, published by Combi et al.
- (2011), with new observations from 2012 and 2018.
- Unlike some comets that have faded over time, except for 2 outbursts seen in the 2012 results, the activity levels for Comet 21P have not changed consistently over time.
- A power-law fit to the pre-perihelion water production rate vs. heliocentric distance for all four apparitions gives a result of 3.75x10^28 x r^-0.28+/-0.4, and that for the post-perihelion production rate, discounting 2012 data dominated by outbursts, gives 4.15 x 10^28 x r^-10.2+/-0.9.
- The production rates are in s^-1 and heliocentric distances are in AU.

##### [Coalescence Instability in Chromospheric Partially Ionised Plasmas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01630) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01630.pdf)

- Fast magnetic reconnection plays a fundamental role in driving explosive dynamics and heating in the solar chromosphere.
- The reconnection time scale of traditional models is shortened at the onset of the coalescence instability, which forms a turbulent reconnecting current sheet through plasmoid interaction.
- In this work we aim to investigate the role of partial ionisation on the development of fast reconnection through the study of the coalescence instability of plasmoids.
- Unlike the processes occurring in fully ionised coronal plasmas, relatively little is known about how fast reconnection develops in partially ionised plasmas of the chromosphere.
- We present 2.5D numerical simulations of coalescing plasmoids in a single fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, and a two-fluid model of a partially ionised plasma (PIP).
- We find that in the PIP model, which has the same total density as the MHD model but an initial plasma density two orders of magnitude smaller, plasmoid coalescence is faster than the MHD case, following the faster thinning of the current sheet and secondary plasmoid dynamics.
- Secondary plasmoids form in the PIP model where the effective Lundquist number $S = 7.8 \cdot 10^3$, but are absent from the MHD case where $S = 9.7 \cdot 10^3$: these are responsible for a more violent reconnection.
- Secondary plasmoids also form in linearly stable conditions as a consequence of the non-linear dynamics of the neutrals in the inflow.
- In the light of these results we can affirm that two-fluid effects play a major role on the processes occurring in the solar chromosphere.

##### [Precision cosmology made more precise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01637) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01637.pdf)

- So far, the standard attitude to solve the Friedmann equations in the simultaneous presence of radiation $R$, matter $M$ and cosmological constant ${\Lambda}$ is to find solutions $R_R (t)$, $R_M (t)$ and $R_{\Lambda} (t)$ separately for each individual component alone, and next to join them together, thereby obtaining a piecewise solution $R_{\rm pw} (t)$.
- We instead find the exact and analytic solution $R (t)$ of the same equations in flat space.
- Moreover, we quantify the error made when $R_{\rm pw} (t)$ is used in place of $R (t)$.

- In recent years, thanks to the continuous surveys performed by INTEGRAL and Swift satellites, our knowledge of the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray sky has greatly improved.
- As a result it is now populated with about 2000 sources, both Galactic and extra-galactic, mainly discovered by IBIS and BAT instruments.
- Many different follow-up campaigns have been successfully performed by using a multi-wavelength approach, shedding light on the nature of a number of these new hard X-ray sources.
- However, a fraction are still of a unidentified nature.
- This is mainly due to the lack of lower energy observations, which usually deliver a better constrained position for the sources, and the unavailability of the key observational properties, needed to obtain a proper physical characterization.
- Here we report on the classification of two poorly studied Galactic X-ray transients IGR J20155+3827 and Swift J1713.4-4219, for which the combination of new and/or archival X-ray and Optical/NIR observations have allowed us to pinpoint their nature.
- In particular, thanks to XMM\Newton archival data together with new optical spectroscopic and archival Optical/NIR photometric observations, we have been able to classify IGR J20155+3827 as a distant HMXB.
- The new INTEGRAL and Swift data collected during the 2019 X-ray outburst of Swift J1713.4-4219, in combination with the archival optical/NIR observations, suggest a LMXB classification for this source.

##### [Calibration of the Surface Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01656) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01656.pdf)

- The Pierre Auger Observatory is designed to study cosmic rays of the highest energies ($>10^{19}$ eV).
- The ground array of the Observatory will consist of 1600 water Cherenkov detectors deployed over 3000 km^2.
- The remoteness and large number of detectors require a robust, automatic self-calibration procedure.
- It relies on the measurement of the average charge collected by a photomultiplier tube from the Cherenkov light produced by a vertical and central through-going muon determined to 5 - 10% at the detector via a novel rate-based technique and to 3% precision through analysis of histograms of the charge distribution.
- The parameters needed for the calibration are measured every minute, allowing for an accurate determination of the signals recorded from extensive air showers produced by primary cosmic rays.
- The method also enables stable and uniform triggering conditions to be achieved.

##### [The Milky Way Project: Probing Star Formation with First Results on Yellowballs from DR2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01661) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01661.pdf)

- Yellowballs (YBs) were first discovered during the Milky Way Project citizen-science initiative (MWP; Simpson et al.
- 2012).
- MWP users noticed compact, yellow regions in Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared (MIR) images of the Milky Way plane and asked professional astronomers to explain these "yellow balls."
- Follow-up work by Kerton et al.
- (2015) determined that YBs likely trace compact photo-dissociation regions associated with massive and intermediate-mass star formation.
- YBs were included as target objects in a version of the Milky Way Project launched in 2016 (Jayasinghe et al.
- 2016), which produced a listing of over 6000 YB locations.
- We have measured distances, cross-match associations, physical properties, and MIR colors of ~500 YBs within a pilot region covering the l= 30 - 40 degrees, b= +/- 1 degree region of the Galactic plane.
- We find 20-30% of YBs in our pilot region contain high-mass star formation capable of becoming expanding H II regions that produce MIR bubbles.
- A majority of YBs represent intermediate-mass star-forming regions whose placement in evolutionary diagrams suggest they are still actively accreting, and may be precursors to optically-revealed Herbig Ae/Be nebulae.
- Many of these intermediate-mass YBs were missed by surveys of massive star-formation tracers and thus this catalog provides information for many new sites of star formation.
- Future work will expand this pilot region analysis to the entire YB catalog.

##### [Spin misalignment of black hole binaries from young star clusters: comparison to GWTC-2 gravitational wave data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01689) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01689.pdf)

- Recent studies indicate that the progenitors of merging black hole (BH) binaries from young star clusters can undergo a common envelope phase just like isolated binaries.
- If the stars emerge from the common envelope as naked cores, tidal interactions can efficiently synchronize their spins before they collapse into BHs.
- Contrary to the isolated case, these binary BHs can also undergo dynamical interactions with other BHs in the cluster before merging.
- The interactions can tilt the binary orbital plane, leading to spin-orbit misalignment.
- We estimate the spin properties of merging binary BHs undergoing this scenario by combining up-to-date binary population synthesis and accurate few-body simulations.
- We show that post-common envelope binary BHs are likely to undergo only a single encounter, due to the high binary recoil velocity and short coalescence times.
- Adopting conservative limits on the binary-single encounter rates, we obtain a local BH merger rate density of ~6.6 yr^-1 Gpc^-3.
- Assuming low (<0.2) natal BH spins, this scenario can reproduce the distributions of effective spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ and precession parameters inferred from GWTC-2, including the negative Xeff and the peak at Xp~0.2.
